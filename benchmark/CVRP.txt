The delivery vehicles have a maximum load capacity of 1 unit and must start and end their routes at the warehouse. The objective is to plan the vehicle routes such that all retail stores are visited exactly once, their demands are fully met, and the total distance traveled is minimized. How can the vehicle routes be optimally arranged to achieve these goals?
