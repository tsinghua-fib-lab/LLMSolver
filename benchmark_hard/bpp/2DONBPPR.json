Each patch can be rotated 90 degrees to better fit the fabric roll. The goal is to minimize the number of fabric rolls used while ensuring all patches are cut without overlap.

The placement process is online, with components arriving sequentially, and future component sizes are unknown. Each component can be rotated to improve space efficiency. The objective is to maximize the number of components placed per board without overlaps, considering only length and width, as height is irrelevant for 2D placement. The challenge involves real-time decision-making to adapt to incoming components while ensuring optimal board space utilization.",
