        "desc_split": "In construction, rectangular ceramic or stone tiles with dimensions <items_size> must be laid out on large floor areas of size <bin_size> to minimize material waste. The tiles can be rotated to create the most efficient pattern, ensuring minimal cutting and optimal use of space. Only the length and width of the tiles and floor area are relevant, as thickness is consistent and not part of the layout problem.",
