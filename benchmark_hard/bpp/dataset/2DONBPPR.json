        "desc_split": "In textile manufacturing, fabric rolls of size <bin_size> must be efficiently cut to produce various swatches of dimensions <items_size>, each representing different patterns or colors. The cutting process is online, as new swatch dimensions are revealed only when requested by clients. Each swatch can be rotated 90 degrees to maximize space utilization. The challenge is to dynamically place each swatch on the roll while minimizing waste, as future swatch sizes are unknown. Only length and width are considered, as fabric thickness is negligible for packing purposes.",

The components arrive sequentially, and future component dimensions are unknown when placing each one. Components can be rotated to optimize placement. The goal is to minimize the number of circuit boards used while ensuring all components fit without overlap. Only length and width are considered, as component height does not affect the 2D layout. The real-time nature of the problem adds complexity, as poor placement decisions may limit future options.",

Packages arrive one by one, and future package sizes are unknown when loading each one. Packages can be rotated to maximize pallet space usage. The objective is to utilize the fewest pallets possible while securely accommodating all packages without overhang. Only length and width are considered, as package thickness is uniform and irrelevant to stacking constraints. The online nature of the problem requires clever real-time placement strategies.",

Ads can be rotated for better space utilization. The challenge lies in dynamically placing each ad optimally while reserving space for unknown future ads. Only length and width are considered, as print thickness is consistent. The goal is to minimize the number of pages used while accommodating all ads without overlap, requiring adaptive placement algorithms.",

The assembly line operates online, requiring placement of components sequentially without prior knowledge of subsequent parts. Each component can be rotated to ensure an efficient layout. Only the length and width of the boards and components matter, as height differences are negligible for placement purposes. The goal is to minimize wasted board space by dynamically positioning each component as it arrives, making real-time adjustments to optimize packing density and board utilization.",

The loading process is online, as packages are placed on the pallet one by one without knowing the sizes of future items. Each package can be rotated 90 degrees for better fit. Only length and width are considered, since parcel heights are managed separately. The objective is to minimize the number of pallets used while ensuring all parcels fit snugly, avoiding wasted space. The problem requires real-time spatial reasoning to maximize pallet efficiency while handling unpredictable parcel sizes dynamically.",

The layout process is online, as content is added sequentially without knowing future block sizes. Each block can be rotated if better alignment or space usage can be achieved. Only length and width matter, as thickness is irrelevant in print layout. The aim is to arrange all blocks neatly while minimizing unused white space, adapting the design dynamically as new elements are introduced onto the page. This requires continuous adaptation to maintain readability while optimizing page coverage.",

The cutting process is online, as measurements arrive piecemeal without prior knowledge of all tiles required. Each smaller tile can be rotated to ensure optimal alignment with the overall design while avoiding wastage. Only the length and width are considered, since tile depths are uniform. The goal is to minimize material waste by strategically arranging all smaller tiles as they become known, cutting efficiently without the ability to foresee all subsequent cutting requirements.",

The cutting process is online, as orders arrive dynamically, and future piece dimensions are unknown. Each piece can be rotated 90 degrees to minimize material waste. The goal is to fit all required pieces onto the fewest possible hides, considering only length and width, as thickness is uniform. The challenge involves optimizing leather usage without prior knowledge of upcoming orders, ensuring minimal scrap while maintaining high-quality cuts.",

The cutting is performed online, with future section dimensions unknown during current placement. Each section can be rotated to maximize panel utilization. Only length and width are relevant, as thickness is standardized. The objective is to minimize the number of panels used while accommodating all sections, requiring adaptive real-time decision-making to reduce material costs.",

The process is online, as each garment order arrives sequentially, and future pattern dimensions are unpredictable. Pieces can be rotated for optimal placement. Only length and width matter, as fabric thickness is negligible. The challenge is to arrange pieces efficiently per roll to minimize wasted fabric, adapting dynamically to varying orders without advance knowledge.",

        "desc_split": "In the clothing industry, large rolls of fabric with size <bin_size> are used to cut out various garment patterns like sleeves, collars, and pant legs with dimensions <items_size>. The cutting process is done online as orders arrive, meaning the dimensions of future patterns are unknown when placing the current one. Each pattern piece can be rotated by 90 degrees to optimize fabric usage. The objective is to minimize fabric waste by efficiently arranging the patterns on the roll, considering only length and width since fabric thickness is negligible. This dynamic arrangement challenge requires smart real-time placement decisions to reduce leftover material while handling unpredictable incoming pattern sizes.",

The process must be done online since customer orders arrive one by one without advance knowledge of future template sizes. Each template can be rotated to fit more efficiently on the sheet. The goal is to use as few cardboard sheets as possible while ensuring all box templates can be cleanly cut. Only the length and width dimensions matter in this two-dimensional layout problem, as cardboard thickness is constant. This requires continuous adaptation to new template dimensions while maximizing sheet utilization.",

The online nature means each advertisement must be placed without knowing what sizes will come next in the queue. All ads can be rotated 90 degrees for optimal positioning. The challenge is to minimize the number of panels used while fitting all customer orders, considering only length and width (as panel thickness remains uniform). This real-time arrangement problem demands careful space management to reduce material costs while accommodating unpredictable design dimensions as they arrive.",

This is an online optimization problem as chip designs arrive sequentially without knowledge of future layouts. Each circuit design can be rotated to improve spatial efficiency. The objective is to maximize wafer usage by minimizing unused space, considering only length and width since wafer thickness is uniform. The challenge lies in making effective real-time placement decisions for incoming chip designs without knowing subsequent layouts.",

The cutting process is online, as orders arrive dynamically, and the exact shapes of future pieces are unknown when cutting the current one. Each piece can be rotated 90 degrees to maximize hide utilization. The goal is to arrange the cuts to minimize leather waste while ensuring all required pieces fit perfectly. Only length and width matter, as thickness is uniform. The challenge lies in efficient real-time placement to reduce costs without foreseeing future part dimensions.",

As orders are processed sequentially without prior knowledge of subsequent parts, the problem is inherently online. Each component can be rotated for optimal positioning. The objective is to reduce material waste by fitting as many parts as possible onto each sheet, considering only length and width.

The cutting process occurs online as demand fluctuates, with unknown future cookie dimensions upon processing each current piece. Each cookie shape can be rotated to maximize space utilization on the dough sheet. The objective is to minimize dough waste by strategically placing cookie cutouts while adhering to production line constraints. Only length and width are considered since dough thickness remains uniform. This requires dynamic arrangement without prior knowledge of upcoming orders.",

The sequence of envelope sizes arrives unpredictably during production, making this an online packing problem where future envelope dimensions are unknown. Each envelope design can be rotated 90 degrees to optimize paper usage. The goal is to produce all required envelopes with minimal paper waste, considering only length and width as paper weight remains consistent. The challenge involves real-time adjustments to cutting patterns based on incoming orders.",

The tile placement occurs online as artists select pieces during creation, with no knowledge of future tile dimensions. Each tile can be rotated to fit the emerging design. The artistic process requires maximizing coverage of the backing board while maintaining aesthetic integrity, focusing only on tile length and width since thickness is uniform. This becomes a creative bin packing challenge where visual appeal complicates pure space optimization.",

This online process occurs as engineering specifications evolve, making future component sizes unpredictable when placing current cuts. Each steel piece can be freely rotated to improve material yield. The shipyard must minimize steel plate consumption while meeting structural strength requirements, considering only two-dimensional measurements as plate thickness remains constant across all components. This high-value cutting problem directly impacts construction costs and timeline efficiency.",

The process is online as book orders arrive unpredictably, and future cover dimensions are unknown. Each piece can be rotated 90 degrees to maximize material usage. The goal is to minimize wasted material by efficiently fitting all cover components onto the sheets while accounting for grain direction limitations. Only length and width matter, as material thickness is negligible. This requires dynamic spatial planning without advance knowledge of upcoming orders, challenging workers to optimize layouts in real-time.",

        "desc_split": "For greenhouse roofs, manufacturers receive large polycarbonate panels of size <bin_size> that must be trimmed into smaller trapezoidal and rectangular sections <items_size> to fit arched frames. Requests arrive incrementally with no visibility of future orders. Panels can be rotated during cutting to better accommodate angled edges while maintaining light transmission properties. The objective is to maximize panel usage by strategically nesting irregular shapes, considering only length and width dimensions (panel thickness remains constant). The online nature demands adaptive cutting strategies to handle unpredictable dimension combinations.",

Each module can be rotated to match connection ports while minimizing gaps between units. Only 2D space (length/width) is relevant as depth is standardized. Production efficiency depends on dynamically arranging incoming modules without knowing subsequent units' sizes, requiring real-time spatial optimization to reduce total panels used, while ensuring pixel alignment and maintenance access pathways.",

The cutting process happens online as orders are received, with future tile dimensions unknown during current slab processing. Tiles can be rotated 90 degrees for better fit. The manufacturer aims to minimize raw material waste by efficiently packing all required tiles onto each slab before moving to the next one, considering only length and width as thickness remains uniform throughout production.",

The die-cutting machine processes orders sequentially without future product knowledge, requiring real-time optimization. Each product outline can be rotated for better packing efficiency. Packaging designers aim to maximize material use on each sheet by strategically arranging ever-changing product shapes, where only the two-dimensional cutout dimensions matter for layout purposes.",

The cutting process must be performed online without prior knowledge of future insole dimensions. Each insole piece can be rotated 90 degrees for better fit. The objective is to minimize material waste by strategically arranging insoles on each sheet. Only length and width affect the layout as thickness is uniform throughout production. This dynamic cutting challenge requires continuous adaptation to incoming orders while maximizing material utilization.",

The die placement occurs sequentially during fabrication without knowledge of future die specifications. Each die can be rotated to optimize wafer space usage. The goal is to maximize the number of dies per wafer while preventing overlaps. Only x-y dimensions matter as wafer thickness is irrelevant to placement. This online packing challenge is crucial for minimizing expensive silicon waste in chip production.",

Patterns arrive sequentially for inclusion, with future designs unknown when placing current elements. All patterns can be rotated for optimal arrangement. The task involves arranging as many diverse stencils as possible on each master sheet while avoiding overlaps. Only planar dimensions are considered as all stencils share uniform thickness. This online optimization problem balances artistic composition with material efficiency.",

Pieces are cut in real-time based on order specifications, with future piece shapes unknown during current cutting operations. All puzzle pieces can be freely rotated for better space utilization. The production target involves minimizing the number of cardboard sheets used across orders by efficiently arranging puzzle pieces. Only length and width matter as thickness remains constant throughout manufacturing. This requires constantly evolving cutting strategies without complete information.",

Equipment arrives sequentially in unpredictable size combinations. Each item can be rotated for better spatial harmony while maintaining safety distances between fixtures.

The cutting process is online, meaning the dimensions of future glass pieces are unknown when cutting the current piece. Each piece can be rotated 90 degrees to optimize the layout. The goal is to minimize the number of large glass panels used while ensuring all smaller pieces are cut without overlapping. Only the length and width of the panels and pieces are considered, as thickness is uniform and irrelevant to the layout. The challenge lies in dynamically arranging the pieces to maximize panel utilization without prior knowledge of upcoming orders.",

The cutting process is online, as orders arrive sequentially, and the dimensions of future components are unknown. Each component can be rotated to fit better on the sheet. The objective is to maximize the utilization of each wooden sheet by strategically placing components to minimize waste. Only length and width are considered, as thickness is consistent. The problem requires real-time decision-making to adapt to incoming component sizes while ensuring efficient use of materials.",

The production is online—each sticker's dimensions are revealed only when it's time to place it on the sheet, and future sticker sizes remain unknown. Each sticker can be rotated to optimize space usage. The task is to arrange all stickers on the minimal number of adhesive sheets while avoiding overlaps. Only the length and width of stickers and sheets matter, as the material's thinness is uniform. Efficient online placement is crucial to reduce material waste and operational costs.",

The patches are cut online, with their sizes only revealed during cutting, meaning future patch dimensions are unknown beforehand. Patch orientation can be rotated to minimize wasted material. The objective is to fit all patches onto the fewest possible composite sheets while respecting geometric constraints. Length and width are the sole considerations since material thickness is standardized. Dynamic planning is required to adapt in real-time to the varying shapes needed in blade production.",

The tiles are placed online, one at a time, with no knowledge of future tile sizes. Each tile can be rotated to better align with the slab's edges or existing tile placements. The goal is to arrange all tiles on the minimal number of concrete slabs while ensuring full coverage without overlapped tiles. Only length and width are considered because the concrete's height is consistent. Real-time optimization balances aesthetics with material efficiency.",

Orders arrive sequentially, so future sticker shapes are unknown at the time of placing the current design. The goal is to minimize wasted space on each sheet while ensuring all stickers are printed without overlap. Only length and width matter, as thickness is negligible. The challenge involves dynamically adjusting sticker positions in real-time without knowing the full set of designs upfront.",

The assembly process is online since module dimensions are revealed only during production. The objective is to maximize panel coverage by minimizing gaps between modules without knowing upcoming sizes. Only the length and width of panels and modules influence placement, as depth is fixed. Real-time adjustments are necessary to avoid inefficient arrangements as modules arrive sequentially.",

The design process is online, as each puzzle's unique piece shapes (<items_size>) cannot be predetermined before cutting begins. Manufacturers optimize board real estate by allowing 360-degree rotation of each piece while prioritizing adjacency for structural integrity post-cutting, with only length and width dimensions impacting the cutting path calculations. As production runs continuously, the system must make irrevocable placement decisions without foresight into subsequent piece geometries.",

The heat-sensitive loading procedure occurs online as workers place pieces sequentially based on kiln readiness, unaware of waiting tile dimensions, rotating each trapezoidal tile as needed for best fit while considering thickness-uniform clay properties by tracking only planar dimensions. Real-time placement struggles to balance shelf space maximization with mandatory thermal airflow gaps that reduce available packing area mid-process.",

Each fresco piece undergoes careful rotation for chromatic alignment and structural interlocking within the 2D plane despite thickness-uniform treatment, requiring real-time spatial decisions under strict no-overlap/no-gap protocols that disregard depth parameters. The fragmented arrangement problem intensifies with each new fragment addition altering possible optimal layouts.",

As each home’s roof layout is unique and panels arrive in unknown sizes, the placement is an online problem where future panel dimensions are unknown. Panels can be rotated 90 degrees to fit irregular roof sections. The goal is to minimize unused roof space while ensuring panels fit without overlapping, considering only length and width. The challenge is to dynamically adapt to panel availability while meeting installation constraints.",

Modules arrive for assembly in unknown sequences, making placement an online problem. They can be rotated for uniformity. Only length and width are considered, as depth is fixed. The goal is to minimize mounting board usage while ensuring modules fit perfectly without gaps. Real-time adjustments are crucial for accommodating varying module sizes during production.",

The cutting process occurs incrementally as design specifications become available, making it an online problem where future patch dimensions are unknown. Each fiber patch can be rotated 90 degrees to maximize material utilization. The challenge involves dynamically arranging irregularly shaped patches while minimizing trim waste, considering only length and width (as material thickness remains constant), to reduce production costs and composite sheet consumption. Since blade designs vary substantially, the algorithm must adapt real-time to unpredictable patch geometries without overlapping placements.",

Production follows an online paradigm – mat orders arrive sequentially without advance knowledge of future orders. Each mat segment can be rotated during placement to optimize material use between cutting patterns. The facility must minimize foam roll consumption (measuring only length and width as thickness is uniform) while fulfilling dynamic order requests, requiring adaptive real-time calculations to position each segment without conflicts as new orders arrive throughout production cycles.",

Tiles arrive continuously from molding stations without prior information about subsequent batches, characterizing an online packing challenge. Each tile can be rotated to improve shelf occupancy during loading. The primary constraint involves maximizing kiln efficiency (considering only length/width as tile height is negligible) by fitting the maximum number per shelf while preventing overlaps, with real-time calculations adjusting for irregular tile size distributions and unexpected production variations during firing cycles.",

The stream of piece dimensions cannot be preprocessed, demanding online decision-making where each piece’s optimal orientation (rotatable 90 degrees) and position is determined before the next piece’s dimensions are known. The objective involves minimizing cardboard usage (tracking solely length and width since thickness is constant) by reducing gaps between pieces, challenging algorithms to incrementally optimize layouts under uncertainty while ensuring accurate die-cut alignment and avoiding manufacturing defects from overlapping cuts.",

Each panel can be rotated 90 degrees to better fit the available roof space. Only the length and width are considered for layout optimization, as panel thickness is uniform. The challenge involves dynamically placing each incoming panel on the roof while avoiding overlaps, without knowledge of future panels' dimensions, aiming to maximize roof coverage and minimize unused space.",

The piece-cutting sequence is unpredictable as designs change mid-production, and each piece can be rotated for optimal placement. Only length and width matter, as thickness remains consistent. The goal is to minimize material waste by efficiently arranging pieces on each master board in real-time, adapting to dynamically arriving piece specifications while ensuring no overlapping cuts occur.",

Each fragile tile can be carefully rotated for better shelf utilization, considering only length and width (as thickness doesn't affect layout).

The installation is an online process, as equipment orders arrive unpredictably and future base dimensions are unknown. Contractors can rotate bases 90 degrees to optimize space utilization. The goal is to minimize the total area of poured concrete by efficiently arranging bases within predefined zones. Only length and width matter since base thickness is uniform. This real-time placement challenge requires adaptive strategies to accommodate varying equipment sizes while maximizing park space efficiency.",

Orders arrive dynamically with unknown future padding requirements, making this an online packing problem. Each padding piece can be rotated to minimize material waste during cutting. The objective is to reduce the number of foam slabs used while meeting all customer specifications. Only two-dimensional footprints are considered, as foam thickness remains constant. The challenge lies in making immediate cutting decisions without knowledge of upcoming orders while ensuring maximal slab utilization.",

Poster combinations change with each exclusive release, requiring online placement where future designs are unknown. Each poster can be rotated 90 degrees for optimal sheet coverage. The aim is to minimize printing costs by reducing the number of sheets used per edition. Only length and width are relevant, as paper thickness is negligible. This demands sophisticated real-time arrangement algorithms to handle unpredictable artwork compositions while maintaining high-quality production standards.",

These panels must be carefully arranged to accommodate various rectangular reinforcement pieces of size <items_size>, which are delivered sequentially without prior knowledge of future dimensions. Each reinforcement piece can be rotated for optimal placement to minimize gaps between components. The challenge lies in real-time arrangement of these pieces to maximize panel utilization, relying only on their length and width. The thickness remains uniform, making this purely a 2D packing problem. The goal is to reduce the number of track bed panels used while ensuring structural integrity and minimizing material waste through dynamic online placement strategies.",

Capsules come in rectangular shapes of varying dimensions <items_size>, with unknown future sizes arriving dynamically during production. Each capsule cavity can be rotated 90 degrees to optimize pack space efficiency. Only the length and width of capsules and blister packs are considered, as height is standardized. The online packing challenge involves placing each incoming capsule in real-time without overlap, minimizing the number of blister packs needed while maintaining organized rows. This continuous decision-making process demands adaptive strategies to handle unpredictable capsule dimension sequences.",

Art pieces arrive sequentially for display, and their future dimensions remain unknown until presented. Each artwork can be rotated for aesthetic or space-saving reasons. The installer must dynamically arrange pieces on panels in real-time, using only length and width parameters (as depth is irrelevant for wall mounting), while maximizing panel coverage. The challenge is to minimize the number of panels while maintaining visually coherent groupings, adapting each placement decision to the constraints of available space without knowing what artwork will follow next in this online packing scenario.",

Components arrive for cutting in unpredictable sequences with dimensions <items_size>, making this an online packing problem where future pieces cannot be anticipated. Each duct piece can be rotated to find optimal orientation on the metal sheet while considering only length and width (as material thickness is fixed). The real-time challenge involves placing components to maximize material utilization from each sheet, minimizing waste and reducing total sheet count. Automated cutting machines must handle this dynamic arrangement problem with no knowledge of upcoming component dimensions.",

Vehicles return randomly for charging, making their arrival sequence and size variations unpredictable in this online packing scenario. Each robot footprint can be rotated within charging bays for better space utilization. The system must dynamically assign real-time parking positions based strictly on length and width (ignoring uniform height) to minimize the number of active charging bays while preventing overlaps. The allocation algorithm must make placement decisions without future robot dimension knowledge to optimize docking area efficiency.",

The artwork placements must be decided on the spot as pieces arrive for display, without knowledge of future incoming artwork sizes. Each framed piece can be rotated 90 degrees to enhance layout flexibility. The goal is to arrange all artworks cohesively while minimizing the number of walls used. Only length and width are considered, as frame depth is standard. This online packing challenge requires real-time spatial decisions to create aesthetically pleasing arrangements without overlapping pieces.",

The cutting is done online as architectural requirements are received sequentially, without foresight of upcoming panel shapes. Each panel design can be rotated for optimal material usage. Engineers must efficiently pack these irregular shapes onto sheets to reduce waste and minimize raw material consumption. Thickness is ignored as all panels share uniform depth. The dynamic nature demands adaptive strategies to handle unknown future panel configurations.",

The pocket arrangement process is online, with future medication types and quantities unknown during current packing. Pockets can be rotated 90 degrees to improve spatial efficiency. The objective is to maximize sheet utilization while ensuring proper spacing between medications. Only length and width dimensions matter, as pocket depth remains constant. This real-time packing problem requires precise calculations to adapt to unpredictable medication dimensions while maintaining production efficiency.",

The installation follows an online process where future equipment types are unknown during current placements. Equipment orientations can be adjusted through 90-degree rotations. Planners must strategically position items to minimize slab usage while meeting safety spacing requirements. Only length and width dimensions are relevant as heights vary independently. This dynamic layout challenge demands flexible arrangement techniques to accommodate unpredictable equipment arrivals during park development.",

The cutting occurs online as orders arrive, with no advanced knowledge of subsequent tile requirements. Tiles can be rotated to maximize material utilization. Manufacturers aim to minimize rubber waste by intelligently nesting tile patterns on each sheet. Thickness remains uniform across all pieces, making only length and width dimensions pertinent. The live processing nature requires continuous optimization as new tile specifications emerge unexpectedly during production.",

        "desc_split": "When assembling digital billboards, mounting frames of size <bin_size> must accommodate various rectangular LED panels with dimensions <items_size>. Panel installation follows an online process where future panel specifications remain unknown during current placement. Each panel can be rotated for better alignment. Technicians need to configure layouts that maximize frame usage while ensuring electrical connectivity between panels. Only length and width are considered, as panel depth is standardized. This real-time packing challenge requires adaptable strategies to handle uncertain panel arrivals while maintaining display integrity.",

The cutting process must be performed online without prior knowledge of future drape dimensions as orders arrive sequentially. Each cutout shape can be rotated 90 degrees to optimize material usage. The challenge involves dynamically arranging these irregular rectangular pieces on the sheet while maximizing utilization and minimizing waste. Only length and width are considered in this two-dimensional optimization problem, as all drapes have uniform thickness.",

The assembly occurs in real-time as various game components arrive unpredictably at the production line. Each board can be rotated to better fit available space. The problem focuses solely on length and width optimization to minimize raw material usage while accommodating an unknown sequence of components, requiring adaptive decision-making for each new board placement.",
