        "desc_split": "When designing printed circuit boards, rectangular components like resistors, capacitors, and ICs of size <items_size> must be placed onto a board of dimensions <bin_size> to maximize space utilization. Components can be rotated to optimize placement, ensuring minimal board usage while avoiding overlaps. Only length and width dimensions matter, as component height is uniform and does not affect layout.",

        "desc_split": "In pharmaceutical packaging, aluminum foils or plastic sheets of size <bin_size> must be divided into individual blister cavities of size <items_size> to hold tablets or capsules. Each cavity must fit precisely within the sheet, allowing rotation to maximize the number of units per pack while minimizing leftover material. Only the length and width dimensions matter, as depth is standardized and irrelevant to the layout optimization.",
