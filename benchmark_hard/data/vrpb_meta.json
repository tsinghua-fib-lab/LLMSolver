Each vehicle must first complete all deliveries before starting pickups due to safety protocols. The challenge is balancing the weight of equipment deliveries with the bulk of ore pickups without exceeding vehicle capacities. The depot locations, equipment demand per site, and ore collection quantities are known. Routes must ensure compliance with weight limits and minimize detours to reduce fuel costs.",

Trucks must first deliver components (high-value, weight-sensitive) before picking up waste (bulky but lighter). The challenge is managing variable load compositions to avoid overloading, ensuring that waste containers are securely stored post-deliveries. Capacity constraints require careful coordination between delivery and pickup stops to prevent vehicle underutilization or overcapacity.",
