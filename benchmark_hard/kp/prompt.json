	"knapsack": "Please provide {number} real-world applications scenario of the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, described in a single paragraph.The weight of a set of items is represented by <item_weight>(without specific values), the value is represented by <item_value>(without specific values), and the weight limit of the knapsack is represented by <knapsack_capacity>(without specific values). The goal is to find the optimal subset of items such that their total value is maximized while not exceeding the capacity of the knapsack.Only the problem descriptions should be provided. The application scenarios should be different, and the problem description should be complete (e.g., problem definition, including the weight and value of the items, as well as the capacity limit of the knapsack, the objective, and potential significance). The language style should be varied. Start each scenario with the industry title enclosed in double hashtags (e.g., ##Project Selection Problem##), followed by a detailed description of the problem. Separate different examples with the symbol &&&. Please output everything in a single paragraph without line breaks.Each example's description should contain exactly one <item_weight>, <item_value>and <knapsack_capacity> symbol.Here is an output template. Please follow this format strictly:"
