After events, teams recover used materials (backhaul) for reuse. Vehicles must adhere to venue-specific `<time_windows>` for setup and teardown, while `<capacity>` limits dictate how much equipment can be transported per trip. Multi-terminal coordination ensures timely deployment and recovery, avoiding fines for missed deadlines or overloaded trucks.",
