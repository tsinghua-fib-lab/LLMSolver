        "content": "A semiconductor manufacturer operates multiple regional distribution centers (`<loc_depot>`) to supply wafer substrates to global assembly plants (`<loc_customer>`). Each truck (`capacity: <capacity> units`) must deliver exact wafer quantities (`<demand>`) to meet production deadlines (`<time_windows>`), which align with factory shift schedules. Time windows are critical to avoid halting assembly lines, and capacity constraints ensure wafer purity isn\u2019t compromised during transport. The problem requires optimizing depot assignments to balance regional inventory and minimize cross-border transit delays.",

Cargo planes (`capacity: <capacity> kg`) must deliver packages (`<demand>`) by flight departure windows (`<time_windows>`), which vary per destination. Ground vehicles at depots also have time constraints for loading/unloading. The challenge involves synchronizing air and ground routes to avoid missed flights, while ensuring no vehicle exceeds weight limits. Multiple depots complicate route planning, as each hub has unique operational hours and inventory.",

Equipment trucks (`capacity: <capacity> units`) depart from regional depots (`<loc_depot>`) to set up stages, lighting, and audio systems. Each venue imposes strict setup windows (`<time_windows>`) before performances, and equipment demands (`<demand>`) vary by event size.

Repair trucks (`capacity: <capacity> units`) carry pipe segments, tools, and spare parts (`<demand>`) to outage sites (`<loc_customer>`). Work must occur within scheduled street closure windows (`<time_windows>`), which overlap with traffic patterns. Capacity constraints limit the number of repair kits per vehicle, and depot assignments depend on geographic zones to minimize response times.
