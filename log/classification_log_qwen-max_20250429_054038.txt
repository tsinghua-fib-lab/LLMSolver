The challenge lies in optimizing the placement of irregularly shaped carbon-fiber sheets purely along their length and width dimensions to achieve maximum coverage, reduce material overlap, and maintain structural integrity while minimizing excess weight.

There is no mention of dealing with items in a sequential manner where future items' dimensions are unknown, which rules out the online variants.

Description: Aerospace technicians must carefully arrange satellite components (<items_size>) with extremely sensitive tolerances into specially designed launch canisters (<bin_size>). The high-value parts become available for loading in variable sequences based on manufacturing completion, with each piece requiring precise 3D orientation. Technicians must maximize space utilization without knowing subsequent components' dimensions, while maintaining exact positioning requirements and shock absorption clearances in all three axes throughout the loading process.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the satellite components (items) and launch canisters (bins) are 3D, with requirements for precise 3D orientation and space utilization. The components become available in a variable sequence, and the dimensions of subsequent items are unknown at the time of loading each piece, which aligns with an online scenario. Additionally, the requirement for exact positioning and shock absorption clearances suggests that the orientation (rotation) of the items is a critical factor, making the rotatable variant more appropriate.

Panels arrive for installation in real-world weather conditions requiring immediate placement without knowledge of subsequent panel dimensions or positions. The challenge involves maximizing roof coverage through careful length/width-based positioning with minimal structural adaptation.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the solar panels (2D items with length and width) must be arranged on rectangular roof sections (also 2D with length and width). It also mentions that the panels arrive for installation in real-world weather conditions, requiring immediate placement without knowledge of subsequent panel dimensions or positions. This matches the characteristics of a 2D Online Bin Packing Problem where items arrive sequentially and their dimensions are unknown until they need to be placed.

Reason: The problem description specifies a two-dimensional cutting optimization task, where the primary goal is to minimize wastage by carefully placing rectangular and L-shaped pieces (items) onto large stainless steel sheets (bins). The problem involves only length and width dimensions, as sheet thickness is ignored. Additionally, the user mentioned that careful placement is required, considering grain directionality, which implies that rotation of items could be necessary for optimal placement.

Description: Municipal bench manufacturing requires cutting long aluminum extrusions of size <bin_size> into various slat lengths <items_size> for different bench models. The production team rotates cutting patterns to maximize material yield from each extrusion, dealing exclusively with length-width optimization as all slats share identical cross-sectional profiles irrelevant to the 2D layout challenge.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the manufacturing process involves cutting long aluminum extrusions into various slat lengths for different bench models, focusing on length-width optimization. This scenario fits a 2D bin packing problem where all items (slats) and bins (extrusions) are defined by their length and width only. The problem does not mention any aspect of 3D dimensions or online (sequential) arrival of items; instead, it emphasizes optimizing the use of material from each extrusion, which suggests an offline approach. Additionally, since the problem specifies that the cross-sectional profiles of the slats are identical and irrelevant to the layout, rotation is not a factor in this context.

Workers cannot predict the exact dimensions or quantities of upcoming beverages, requiring real-time decisions about how to orient each item based on its length, width, and height to maximize crate utilization while preventing breakage during transit.
Reason: The problem description specifies that items (bottles and cans) have three dimensions (length, width, and height) and must be packed into 3D bins (plastic crates). It also indicates that the items arrive continuously, meaning the dimensions of upcoming items are not known in advance, which fits the "online" setting.

Engineers need to optimally position parts on each sheet considering only the length and width constraints, often incorporating geometric nesting of irregularly shaped pieces to minimize expensive composite wastage while meeting structural grain alignment specifications.
Reason: The problem description specifies the need to optimally position irregularly shaped 2D aircraft components on large composite sheets, considering length and width constraints. It also mentions the importance of geometric nesting, which implies that rotation of parts could be a strategy to minimize waste. Since the process is planned with all items known beforehand (offline), and rotation seems to be a considered factor for optimization, the most suitable variant is 2DOFBPPR, which allows for the placement and rotation of 2D items into 2D bins while knowing all items in advance.

Reason: The problem description mentions that the furniture components have distinct length, width, and height, indicating a 3D packing problem. Additionally, it specifies that the items arrive without prior knowledge of their dimensions, which fits the online nature of the problem. The need to maximize space utilization while preventing damage during transit suggests the possibility of rotating items for better fit, although rotation is not explicitly mentioned, the flexibility in arrangement implies rotation could be beneficial.

Reason: The problem involves loading 3D items (components like air filtration units and sterile workstations) into 3D bins (trucks). The loading sequence is unpredictable, which means the items arrive sequentially, and their dimensions are unknown until they need to be placed. There is no mention of rotating the items, so rotation is not allowed. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is the 3D Online Bin Packing Problem (3DONBPP).

Reason: The problem description specifies that the distribution center handles 3D items (server racks, home assistant hubs, and smart displays) which have length, width, and height. These items need to be placed into 3D storage racks (bins) with the goal of achieving a high occupancy rate. The description also emphasizes the careful vertical stacking of fragile components, indicating that the orientation or rotation of items is a critical factor in preventing damage.

Reason: The problem describes the need to pack books of various sizes into shipping boxes, which implies that we are dealing with 3D items (length, width, and height). The stacks of books arrive in random distributions, indicating an online scenario where the dimensions of upcoming items are unknown when placing the current item.

Reason: The problem description indicates that the marine scientists need to fit 3D items (sonar arrays, water samplers, and submarine drones) into a 3D space (research vessel holds) with strict dimension limits. The need for custom positioning of these fragile instruments suggests that the orientation or rotation of items is a critical factor to prevent damage.

The challenge involves arranging complex polygonal shapes while respecting material grain directions and structural load requirements for each aerospace-grade component.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the cutting involves 2D components (length and width) from composite sheets, which matches a 2D bin packing problem. The requirement to account for material grain directions and structural load requirements suggests that the orientation (rotation) of the components on the sheet is important, indicating a rotatable bin packing problem. Since all rib profiles are known and must be positioned on each sheet, this aligns with an offline scenario where all items are known before the packing process begins.
