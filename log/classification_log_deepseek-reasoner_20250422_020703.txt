Description: A volcanic observatory must resupply remote research stations with equipment (<demand_linehaul> kg) while collecting lava samples (<demand_backhaul> kg) for analysis. Helicopters depart from a base camp (<loc_depot>) with a maximum payload capacity (<capacity> kg) and a flight range limit (<distance_limit> km) due to fuel and safety regulations. Deliveries must be completed before sample pickups to ensure researchers have tools before collecting hazardous materials. Routes must also account for unpredictable volcanic activity to minimize detours.
Reason: The problem requires helicopters to deliver linehaul goods before collecting backhaul samples (B), has a flight range limit (L), and does not explicitly require returning to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). The combination of O, B, and L makes OVRPBL the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 86
Description: Mountain rescue teams need to deploy emergency equipment (e.g., ropes, medical kits) to remote mountainous locations and retrieve used gear after operations. Each rescue vehicle has a capacity limit for both delivering equipment and carrying back used items. Due to rugged terrain, routes must not exceed a set distance to ensure safe return. The goal is to optimize routes to cover all rescue sites while adhering to capacity and distance constraints.
Reason: The problem involves both delivery and retrieval (backhaul) of items, with backhaul operations likely occurring after deliveries (as per "retrieve used gear after operations"), which aligns with the Backhaul (B) aspect. Additionally, there are distance constraints (L) due to the rugged terrain. The presence of both B and L makes VRPBL the most specific variant. Capacity is mentioned but superseded by B and L. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 68
Description: A renewable energy company transports turbine blades, generators, and installation tools to offshore wind farm sites while collecting decommissioned turbine components and scrap metal from retired platforms. Each vessel must sequence deliveries and pickups efficiently, adhering to weight limits, and finish routes at the last visited site to minimize operational costs.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles finish at the last visited site, not returning to the depot) and backhaul demands (collecting decommissioned components after deliveries). While weight limits are mentioned, the presence of "O" (open route) and "B" (backhaul) takes precedence over "C". There is no indication of distance limits ("L") or time windows ("TW"), so the most specific variant is OVRPB.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 10
Description: An online retailer must deliver new merchandise to customers while simultaneously collecting returned items for resell or recycling. Delivery trucks (with a <capacity> kg capacity) start at the warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering packages to <num_customer> locations (<loc_customer>) with specific order weights (<demand_linehaul>). After completing all deliveries, the same trucks must proceed to designated return points (backhaul customers) to collect returned goods (<demand_backhaul>). The route must ensure deliveries precede pickups to prevent overloading during the return phase. Additionally, each truck’s total travel distance must stay under a <distance_limit> km limit to avoid driver fatigue and ensure efficient fuel use. The goal is to minimize total distance while respecting capacity and distance constraints.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) with the constraint that deliveries must precede pickups (B), and a distance limit (L) for each truck. There is no mention of time windows (TW), open routes (O), or mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPBL, which combines backhaul and distance limit constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 89
Description: A wellness company expands its network of mountain retreats, requiring delivery of exercise machines and yoga gear. Each retreat (<loc_customer>) has staff availability windows (<time_windows>) for unloading. Delivery vans (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a distribution center (<loc_depot>), but steep mountain roads restrict their travel range (<distance_limit> km). The goal is to schedule routes ensuring all equipment arrives within time constraints, while preventing overloading and avoiding route distances beyond the vans’ operational limits.
Reason: The problem includes time windows (<time_windows>) for service at retreats (TW), distance limits (<distance_limit>) due to mountain roads (L), and vehicle capacity constraints. However, the user instructions specify that "C" (capacity) is ignored when other features (TW, L, etc.) are present. Thus, the most specific variant combining L (distance limits) and TW (time windows) is VRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 86
Description: A film festival organizer must deploy high-value projectors to theaters for screenings and securely collect them afterward. Each theater has specific time windows for setup (delivery) and teardown (pickup). Delivery trucks (<capacity> capacity) must deliver projectors before screenings start and retrieve them immediately after, ensuring no truck exceeds its capacity. The challenge is coordinating routes to meet all venue time windows while optimizing fuel costs and safeguarding equipment.
Reason: The problem requires both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) operations at each theater with specific time windows for each. Since pickups (backhauls) can occur after their corresponding deliveries (linehauls) but may be interleaved with deliveries to other theaters (as time windows vary), this necessitates a Mixed Backhaul (MB) approach. Additionally, each theater has time window constraints (TW) for both delivery and pickup. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 66
Description: A farm machinery rental company delivers tractors and harvesters to farms before harvest season and later collects the equipment along with the harvested crops. Vehicles must carry both machinery (deliveries) and crops (pickups) without exceeding capacity. Farms have strict time windows for equipment delivery (to align with planting/harvest schedules) and crop pickup. Routes must be planned to ensure vehicles return to the depot before sunset, adhering to daily distance limits.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as vehicles must handle both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul), distance limits (L) due to daily distance constraints and the requirement to return before sunset, and time windows (TW) for equipment delivery and crop pickup. The presence of B, L, and TW makes VRPBLTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 3
Description: An online retailer’s fleet delivers new products to customers (linehaul) while also collecting returned items (backhaul) for redistribution. Each truck has a limited capacity and must stay within a daily distance limit. Routes start at the distribution center but finish at the last delivery/pickup location, streamlining operations to reduce fuel costs and improve customer satisfaction.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, backhaul demands (B) for returned items, and distance limits (L). Capacity constraints exist but are superseded by other features (O, B, L). No time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB) are mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 32
Description: A storage provider offers temporary units (e.g., portable sheds) to customers needing space for home renovations or seasonal storage. Vehicles transport empty units (<demand_linehaul>) to customers’ addresses during morning delivery windows (<time_windows>), then collect full units (<demand_backhaul>) at scheduled pickup times. Each truck’s capacity (<capacity>) must accommodate the weight of loaded units (filled with items) versus empty ones. Routes are open-ended, ending at the final collection point, with flexible sequencing to minimize idle time between stops.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at the final collection point, backhaul demand (B) with separate linehaul and backhaul phases (deliver empty units first, collect loaded ones later), and time windows (TW) for deliveries and pickups. There is no mention of mixed backhaul (MB) or distance limits (L), making OVRPBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 4
Description: A pharmacy network delivers critical medications to clinics (linehaul) and collects expired drugs for safe disposal (backhaul). Each clinic has time windows for deliveries (to ensure drug efficacy) and pickups (to meet regulatory deadlines). Trucks originate from a central warehouse but finish at their last stop. The objective is to sequence deliveries and pickups efficiently while staying under capacity limits. Early arrivals must wait until the clinic’s opening time, while delays risk drug expiration or compliance violations.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (trucks do not return to the depot), backhaul demands (separate pickups of expired drugs after deliveries), and time window constraints for both deliveries and pickups. These correspond to the O (open route), B (backhaul), and TW (time windows) attributes. There is no mention of distance limits (L) or mixed backhauls (MB), as the problem does not explicitly allow simultaneous handling of linehaul and backhaul in any order.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 33
Description: A brewery supplies full beer kegs to pubs (linehaul) and collects empties (backhaul) for sterilization. Pubs require kegs delivered before opening hours (e.g., 8 AM) and empties picked up after closing (e.g., 12 AM). Trucks must account for weight differences: a full keg is 150kg, while an empty one is 30kg. A route might first deliver kegs to a busy downtown bar (by 9 AM), then backtrack to collect empties from a suburban pub (by 1 AM), all within a <capacity>-ton limit.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (B) and time window (TW) constraints. Pubs require kegs delivered before opening hours and empties picked up after closing, indicating time windows. The collection of empties (backhaul) occurs after delivering full kegs (linehaul), aligning with the backhaul definition. Capacity constraints exist but are secondary to B and TW. There is no mention of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhauls (MB). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 68
Description: A safety equipment provider supplies hardhats, harnesses, and tools to construction sites, then retrieves used gear for sterilization. Vehicles (<capacity> kg) must deliver equipment before <time_window> start times to avoid delays in site operations. After crews finish shifts, trucks return to the same sites to collect gear, ensuring no pickups occur until all deliveries are complete. The <service_time> includes safety inspections at each site, requiring precise scheduling to meet strict occupational health deadlines.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles that must deliver equipment before specific time windows (<time_window>) and later collect used gear after all deliveries are completed, indicating backhaul (B) constraints. Additionally, time windows (TW) are explicitly mentioned for deliveries. The presence of both backhaul and time window constraints makes VRPBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 90
Description: A global satellite operator must deploy communication equipment to remote ground stations and retrieve outdated gear for recycling. Trucks depart from a central depot to deliver new equipment (linehaul) before collecting old units (backhaul) to avoid cross-contamination. Each site has strict installation and retrieval time windows tied to satellite orbital passes. Vehicles must complete routes within a 12-hour window (duration limit) to ensure daylight operations, and payloads cannot exceed truck capacities. The challenge is balancing equipment delivery with pickup schedules while adhering to tight operational timelines.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands with the requirement that backhaul (retrieval) occurs only after completing linehaul (delivery), indicating a backhaul (B) constraint. Each site has strict time windows (TW) tied to satellite passes. Although there is a 12-hour duration limit, this is considered a time window constraint rather than a distance limit (L). Capacity constraints (C) are present but ignored due to the presence of B and TW. There is no mention of open routes (O) or mixed backhauls (MB). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 7
Description: A furniture retailer partners with an appliance recycling program to deliver new sofas and appliances (linehaul) to customers’ homes while simultaneously collecting old furniture and electronics (backhaul). Delivery trucks have a <capacity> kg limit to balance the weight of outgoing items (e.g., heavy sofas) and incoming recyclables (e.g., TVs, mattresses). Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km range to avoid long detours, and drivers conclude their routes at the final customer address. The company seeks cost-effective delivery paths that maximize recycling pickup without overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as drivers end at the final customer, mixed backhaul (MB) since linehaul and backhaul are handled simultaneously, and distance limits (L). There are no time windows (TW) mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 9
Description: A school district manages a program to deliver pre-packaged meals to campuses while collecting reusable containers from previous days. Meals must arrive by specific morning time windows to ensure timely distribution, while empty containers are picked up after lunch periods. Delivery trucks handle outbound perishable goods (linehaul) and inbound container returns (backhaul), with capacity constraints to prevent spoilage or overflow. The plan must also account for varying container counts per school and strict meal freshness deadlines.
Reason: The problem involves both time window constraints (meals must arrive by specific morning times, containers picked up after lunch) and backhaul demands (delivering meals as linehaul and collecting containers as backhaul). Since backhaul is handled after linehaul and time windows are specified for each task, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 75
Description: A school district needs to distribute science lab kits to schools for seasonal science fairs and collect them afterward. Each school has a time window for delivery setup and a separate window for post-event returns. Delivery trucks must first deliver the kits (linehaul) before returning to collect the used equipment (backhaul). Each truck has a capacity limit for both new and returned items. Routes must stay within a maximum distance to prevent driver exhaustion, ensuring all deliveries are completed before the fairs begin and pickups occur after the events conclude.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW) for both delivery and pickup, backhaul (B) as trucks must first deliver before collecting returns, and distance limits (L) to prevent driver exhaustion. The sequence of linehaul before backhaul aligns with the 'B' constraint (no mixed backhaul), and all three features (B, L, TW) are present. There is no mention of open routes (O), so the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 19
Description: An agricultural logistics firm delivers farming equipment (tractors, harvesters) to rural farms (linehaul) and collects harvested crops (backhaul) for processing. Vehicles must deliver machinery before the harvest window (time constraints) and then collect crops immediately after. Each truck has a capacity limit for both equipment and crop loads. Routes are restricted by distance to ensure accessibility in remote areas. The challenge is to synchronize deliveries and pickups, ensuring farmers can begin harvesting promptly and crops are retrieved before spoilage, while respecting operational limits.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as crops are collected after delivering equipment, distance limits (L) due to route accessibility constraints, and time windows (TW) for delivering equipment before harvest and collecting crops immediately after. These elements are all present and critical, making VRPBLTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 1
Description: A pharmaceutical distributor must deliver temperature-sensitive medications to clinics (linehaul) and collect expired drugs or medical waste (backhaul) for secure disposal. Each vehicle has a capacity limit and must stay within a predefined daily travel distance. Routes start at the central warehouse but conclude at the final stop, optimizing both delivery efficiency and waste collection while complying with strict safety regulations.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles that start at the depot but do not return (Open route - O), handle both linehaul and backhaul demands (B) where backhaul (expired drugs collection) is likely performed after linehaul (deliveries) based on safety compliance, and have a daily travel distance limit (L). No explicit time window constraints (TW) are mentioned, so TW is excluded. The combination of O, B, and L makes OVRPBL the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 45
Description: A healthcare organization deploys mobile medical units to rural areas, requiring vehicles to deliver medical equipment and supplies (linehaul) to remote clinics and collect used or expired medical materials (backhaul) for recycling or restocking. Each vehicle starts from a central warehouse but ends its route at the final destination without returning, optimizing paths to balance capacity constraints while ensuring all clinics receive necessary gear and waste is efficiently retrieved.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles that do not return to the depot (Open route, "O") and requires handling both linehaul (delivery) and backhaul (collection) demands. Since backhaul is mentioned as a separate activity after linehaul (not mixed), the "B" (backhaul) variant applies. No explicit time window or distance limit constraints are mentioned, and capacity is secondary to "O" and "B" features. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPB.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 2
Description: A construction company sends trucks to deliver building materials (linehaul) to active sites and collect unused debris (backhaul) for recycling. Each truck has a weight capacity and must adhere to a maximum route distance to ensure driver safety and fuel efficiency. Routes begin at the supply depot but end at the last site visited, minimizing detours and maximizing the utility of each vehicle’s load.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as trucks end at the last site and do not return to the depot, backhaul (B) for debris collection after linehaul deliveries, and distance limits (L) for route constraints. There is no mention of mixed backhaul (MB) or time windows (TW). Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 94
Description: A construction firm uses prefabricated building modules (<demand_linehaul>) for high-rise projects but must also remove on-site waste (<demand_backhaul>) like scrap metal. Construction sites (<loc_customer>) have restricted access windows (<time_windows>) to minimize disruptions—deliveries may only occur during non-working hours, while waste pickups align with cleanup shifts. A truck (<capacity>) might first transport a bathroom module to a site at midnight (outside work hours), then collect debris from another site at 3 PM (during scheduled cleanup). Routes must balance load constraints and respect tight site availability schedules to avoid project delays.  
```
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering modules) and backhaul (collecting waste), which must be handled in sequence (deliveries first, pickups later), aligning with 'B'. Time windows are specified for both delivery and pickup operations, necessitating 'TW'. There is no mention of open routes ('O') or distance limits ('L'), and capacity constraints are present but secondary to 'B' and 'TW'. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 22
Description: A mobile grocery service delivers fresh produce in reusable crates to urban neighborhoods (<loc_customer>) while collecting empty crates for redistribution. Trucks must balance outgoing produce (<demand_linehaul>) and returning crates (<demand_backhaul>), never exceeding their capacity (<capacity>). The routes begin at the distribution center (<loc_depot>), end at the last delivery/pickup location, and must stay within a distance limit (<distance_limit>) to ensure timely delivery of perishables.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at the last location and do not return to the depot, backhaul demands (B) with returning crates, and a distance limit (L) constraint. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB), so the most specific variant is OVRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 12
Description: A live event management firm needs to transport technicians, performers, and crew to venues (linehaul) and retrieve temporary equipment (e.g., sound systems, stage props) afterward (backhaul). Venues have strict time windows for setup and teardown, and staff must arrive precisely when events begin. Buses and trucks must handle mixed loads (people and equipment) within capacity limits, with routes concluding at the final destination to avoid unnecessary return trips.
Reason: The problem requires open routes (vehicles do not return to the depot), backhaul demand (retrieving equipment after linehaul deliveries), and strict time windows at venues. Mixed loads are allowed, but the presence of "O", "B", and "TW" takes precedence over capacity constraints. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 70
Description: A chemical logistics company must deliver hazardous materials to industrial facilities (linehaul) and retrieve used containers for recycling (backhaul). Each delivery must occur within the client’s operational hours (TW), while pickups align with environmental regulations. Vehicles have strict capacity limits (C) to avoid overloading. Routes must stay within a daily distance limit (L) to comply with safety protocols. Starting from the depot, drivers first deliver chemicals, then collect waste containers, ending the route at the depot for proper disposal—ensuring no unnecessary return trips beyond the final task.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as it requires retrieving used containers after deliveries, distance limits (L) due to daily distance constraints, and time windows (TW) for both deliveries and pickups. The route starts and ends at the depot, ruling out 'O' variants. The strict separation of linehaul and backhaul (no mixing) aligns with 'B' rather than 'MB'. Thus, the combination of B, L, and TW makes 'VRPBLTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 20
Description: A regional distributor supplies grocery stores with fresh produce in refrigerated trucks starting from the central warehouse (<loc_depot>). Each store (<loc_customer>) requires a specific quantity of goods (<demand>) and must receive deliveries before their morning opening hours (<time_windows>). After unloading, the trucks must collect empty crates left by stores for recycling (<demand_backhaul>). Trucks cannot exceed their <capacity> ton limit and must prioritize deliveries before pickups. Routes must stay within a maximum distance of <distance_limit> km to ensure drivers finish before dusk. The goal is to plan efficient routes that respect time windows, prevent overloading, and avoid unnecessary returns to the depot.
Reason: The problem includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>), and distance limits (<distance_limit>). Deliveries must be prioritized before pickups (B), routes have distance constraints (L), and time windows (TW) are enforced. Since O (open route) is not mentioned (trucks "avoid unnecessary returns to the depot" but are not prohibited from returning), the variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 21
Description: A catering company delivers hot meals to corporate events (<demand_linehaul>) and collects uneaten portions (<demand_backhaul>) for donation or composting. Meals must be delivered within 30 minutes of event start times (<time_windows>), while pickups occur after events conclude. Each vehicle (capacity <capacity> meals) has a 6-hour operating window (<duration_limit>). The goal is to optimize routes so meal deliveries precede pickups, prevent temperature breaches, and ensure timely service without overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem includes both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) with the requirement that deliveries must precede pickups (B). Time windows are specified for both deliveries and pickups (TW). There is a vehicle capacity constraint, but according to the guidelines, "C" is ignored when other features like B or TW are present. The 6-hour operating window for vehicles is a duration constraint, but "L" refers to distance limits, which are not mentioned. Mixed backhaul (MB) is not applicable since pickups occur strictly after deliveries. Open routes (O) are not specified, so the standard closed VRP is assumed. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 87
Description: A biotech company uses drones to transport time-sensitive medical samples (<demand_linehaul>) to laboratories and retrieve sterilized lab equipment (<demand_backhaul>) from remote testing sites. Each drone has a limited payload capacity (<capacity>) and battery range (<distance_limit>). Sites require deliveries and pickups within strict time windows (<time_windows>) to ensure sample viability. Drones land at the final destination after completing their routes, eliminating return trips to the base (<loc_depot>).
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as drones do not return to the depot, backhaul demand (B) for sterilized equipment retrieval, distance limits (L) due to battery constraints, and time windows (TW) for deliveries/pickups. These features align with the OVRPBLTW variant, which explicitly includes all mentioned constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 43
Description: A gas supplier redistributes oxygen/acetylene cylinders between industrial facilities. Each plant has a maintenance shutdown window <time_windows> when cylinders must be replaced. Cylinder demands <demand> vary by facility, but trucks cannot exceed their weight/size capacity <capacity> due to vehicle specifications. Travel speed is <speed>, and swaps take <service_time> minutes. Routes must start/end at the central gas depot, ensuring no facility is left without cylinders during critical production halts while optimizing route efficiency.
Reason: The problem includes time windows (<time_windows>) for service at each facility and requires handling cylinder swaps, which likely involve both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) in a mixed manner (as swaps imply simultaneous exchange). Additionally, vehicle capacity constraints (<capacity>) are present. The routes must start/end at the depot, ruling out "O" variants. The combination of mixed backhaul (MB) and time windows (TW) makes VRPMBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 23
Description: A staffing agency transports temporary workers to event venues (linehaul) and retrieves them post-shift (backhaul). Workers must arrive at venues precisely during setup windows (<time_windows>), and pickups occur after events end. Buses (<capacity> passengers) cannot operate beyond a 10-hour daily limit (<duration_limit>). Routes must prioritize venue drop-offs before staff pickups, avoiding overtime penalties while minimizing idle time between stops.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as workers must be picked up after drop-offs, and time windows (TW) for both linehaul and backhaul. The duration limit is a constraint but does not align with the given definition of L (distance limits). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 16
Description: An electronics retailer delivers new appliances to customers' homes (linehaul) and collects outdated devices for recycling (backhaul). Each delivery vehicle has a capacity limit for both outgoing and incoming loads. Deliveries must occur during customers' specified time windows (e.g., daytime for appliance setup), followed by pickups after the customer has prepared the old devices. Routes must not exceed a set distance to ensure drivers can complete tasks within a single shift. The goal is to optimize routes so all deliveries and pickups are completed efficiently without exceeding capacity or time/distance constraints.
Reason: The problem includes backhaul (B) with sequential delivery and pickup, distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). Deliveries must occur first during specified time windows, followed by pickups, and routes are constrained by distance. The presence of B, L, and TW makes VRPBLTW the most specific variant.

Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 62
Description: A research organization supplies field equipment (e.g., sensors, lab kits) to remote research stations in Arctic or jungle regions and later retrieves used gear for maintenance. Deliveries and pickups must occur during narrow time windows when ice roads or seasonal weather permit access. Vehicles must handle fragile scientific instruments while adhering to strict weight and space constraints.
Reason: The problem involves both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) of equipment, with strict time windows ("narrow time windows when ice roads or seasonal weather permit access"). Since backhaul demand (B) and time window constraints (TW) are explicitly mentioned, and there is no indication that vehicles can handle linehaul and backhaul simultaneously (mixed backhaul), the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 81
Description: A luxury yacht charter company deploys equipment (e.g., water toys, linens) to yachts anchored at distant ports and retrieves used items afterward. Delivery must precede pickup for each yacht. Yachts have time windows for loading/unloading based on tidal schedules or client availability. The vessels used for logistics have limited capacity, and routes are constrained by fuel ranges (distance limits) to avoid mid-trip refueling. The goal is to minimize travel distance while ensuring all equipment is delivered on time and retrieved promptly.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW) for loading/unloading, distance limits (L) due to fuel constraints, and backhaul demands where delivery (linehaul) must precede pickup (backhaul) for each yacht, which fits the mixed backhaul (MB) definition as the sequence is per yacht rather than all linehauls before backhauls. This combination of MB, L, and TW makes VRPMBLTW the most specific variant.

Label: CVRP, Predicted: OVRP, Index: 10
Description: A region experiencing severe drought requires urgent water distribution to <num_customer> towns scattered across arid zones. Water tankers depart from a central reservoir (<loc_depot>) and must deliver precise amounts of water (<demand> liters) to each town. Each tanker has a maximum capacity of <capacity> liters, and routes must be planned to ensure no vehicle is overloaded while reaching every town exactly once. The goal is to minimize fuel consumption and maximize water delivery efficiency, ensuring critical resources reach all areas without compromise.
Reason: The problem requires delivering precise amounts of water with vehicle capacity constraints but does not explicitly mention vehicles returning to the depot. The absence of a return requirement aligns with the Open VRP (OVRP) variant, where routes do not need to end at the depot. While capacity is a constraint, the presence of the open route attribute (O) takes precedence over capacity (C) according to the classification rules.

Description: Marathon organizers must deliver water, medical supplies, and first-aid kits to aid stations (linehaul) and collect empty containers and waste (backhaul) post-event. Trucks (capacity: 4 tons) must stay under an 80km route limit to ensure timely setup. Deliveries must occur before the race starts (within strict time windows), while pickups must follow the finish line closing time. Flexible sequencing of stops balances load limits and operational deadlines for a seamless event.
Reason: The problem includes backhaul (B) as pickups must follow after deliveries, distance limits (L) with trucks staying under 80km, and time window constraints (TW) for both deliveries and pickups. The presence of all three features (B, L, TW) makes VRPBLTW the most specific variant.

Description: A production company must set up temporary stages for a multi-city music festival. Trucks deliver sound systems, lighting rigs, and backdrops (linehaul) to venues with setup time windows aligned with crew availability. After performances, they collect equipment (backhaul) without delaying cleanup crews. Each route must finish within an 10-hour shift (duration limit), and trucks cannot overload with mixed delivery/pickup loads. The goal is to minimize travel distance while respecting venue schedules and vehicle capacities.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) since equipment must be collected after performances, time windows (TW) aligned with crew availability, and no mixed loads, requiring linehaul to be completed before backhaul. The 10-hour shift is a duration limit, but according to the definitions, "L" refers to distance limits, which are not mentioned. Hence, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.

Description: A public health organization deploys mobile testing units to rural and urban areas during disease outbreaks. Trucks (<capacity>) carry medical supplies (<demand_linehaul>) to vaccination or screening sites (<loc_customer>), then collect used materials like syringes or test kits (<demand_backhaul>). Routes are planned to avoid returning to the central depot (<loc_depot>), ending at the final location. Each route must stay within a maximum distance (<distance_limit>) to ensure teams can operate within a single shift while efficiently balancing deliveries and pickups.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, backhaul demand (B) requiring linehaul completion before backhaul, and distance limits (L) to ensure routes fit within shift durations. Time windows (TW) are not explicitly mentioned, and mixed backhaul (MB) is not applicable since linehaul precedes backhaul. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 24
Description: A disaster response team deploys rescue kits (<demand_linehaul>) to affected communities and retrieves used equipment (<demand_backhaul>) for restocking. Deployments must occur within critical 2-hour windows (<time_windows>) after crisis alerts, while pickups follow 24-hour post-deployment. Each vehicle (<capacity> gear units) has a 12-hour operational limit (<duration_limit>). The solution requires prioritizing urgent deliveries, ensuring return trips do not exceed time constraints, and managing fluctuating demand across disaster zones.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW) for both linehaul (2-hour window) and backhaul (24-hour window), backhaul demand (B) that is satisfied after linehaul, and vehicles must return to the depot (no open route). The 12-hour operational limit is a duration constraint, but since 'L' in the provided definitions refers to distance limits (not time), it is not included. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW, combining backhaul and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 59
Description: A university’s dining services delivers fresh meal kits to campus buildings (deliveries) and collects organic waste from kitchens for composting (pickups). Each van has a capacity limit for perishables and waste. Deliveries must arrive before meal preparation time (time windows), and pickups must occur after meal service ends. Routes must stay within the campus perimeter (distance limit) to ensure same-day service, while avoiding traffic congestion during peak hours.
Reason: The problem includes backhaul (pickups after deliveries), distance limits (campus perimeter), and time windows (deliveries before meal prep, pickups after service), aligning with the 'B', 'L', and 'TW' attributes. No indication of open routes (O) or mixed backhaul (MB) is provided. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 72
Description: A mobile scientific team delivers lab equipment to remote research stations (linehaul) and retrieves environmental or biological samples for analysis (backhaul). Vehicles originate from a central lab depot but conclude their routes at the final destination. Capacity limits on each truck require balancing the weight of bulky equipment with fragile or perishable samples. The solution must optimize routes to ensure all field sites are serviced efficiently while adhering to strict cargo constraints.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles do not return to the depot, indicated by 'O') and backhaul demands (retrieving samples after delivering equipment, indicated by 'B'). There is no mention of time windows ('TW'), distance limits ('L'), or mixed backhaul ('MB'), which allows simultaneous linehaul and backhaul. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPB.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 18
Description: A foodservice supplier delivers cooking oil, spices, and kitchenware to restaurants while collecting used cooking oil for biodiesel production. The trucks (capacity <capacity>) begin at the central warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering fresh supplies to multiple eateries. After completing all deliveries, the same vehicles collect the used oil from the same locations. This ensures that the vehicle’s capacity is not exceeded during deliveries and that hazardous materials are handled safely in the return phase. The aim is to optimize routes for minimal fuel costs and environmental impact.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles delivering goods first (linehaul) and then collecting used oil (backhaul) in sequence, which aligns with the Backhaul (B) constraint. There is no mention of open routes (O), time windows (TW), distance limits (L), or mixed backhauls (MB). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPB.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 93
Description: A gourmet food supplier delivers fresh ingredients (<demand_linehaul>) to restaurants (<loc_customer>) while collecting expired stock (<demand_backhaul>) for composting. Restaurants operate on strict schedules (<time_windows>), requiring deliveries before dinner service starts and pickups after closing. A vehicle (<capacity>) might first drop off sushi-grade fish to a sushi bar by 9 AM, then collect expired dairy from a café by 10 PM. Routes must ensure load limits are not exceeded and all stops occur within their designated hours to avoid service disruptions.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands (B) with specific time windows (TW) for each stop. Additionally, the example provided does not mention the vehicle returning to the depot, suggesting open routes (O). The presence of these features (O, B, TW) makes OVRPBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 92
Description: A research organization deploys mobile labs to remote environmental monitoring sites to collect soil, water, or air samples for analysis. The labs are loaded with equipment (linehaul) at a central hub (<loc_depot>) and then transported to field locations (<loc_customer>). After deployment, the same trucks must return to each site to retrieve the collected samples (backhaul) and empty lab equipment. Each vehicle’s capacity (<capacity>) must accommodate both outbound gear and inbound samples, while routes must stay within a distance limit (<distance_limit>) to prevent excessive travel. The goal is to optimize routes that end at the final collection point, avoiding depot returns, and ensuring no vehicle overloads.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles end at the final collection point, not the depot: 'O'), backhaul demands (samples retrieved after initial deployment: 'B'), and distance limits on routes ('L'). These correspond to the 'OVRPBL' variant. Mixed backhaul (MB) is not applicable since backhaul is only addressed after linehaul completion, and there is no mention of time windows (TW).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 6
Description: A cooperative organizes trucks (<capacity> kg capacity) to collect perishable crops like strawberries and lettuce from <num_customer> farms (<loc_customer>). Each farm specifies a harvest-ready time window (<time_windows>) to prevent spoilage, and the truck must arrive precisely to load the produce (<demand>). The vehicles depart from the central hub (<loc_depot>), but after collecting all assigned crops, they proceed directly to processing plants without returning to the depot. This minimizes delays and ensures freshness.
Reason: The problem specifies that trucks do not return to the depot (Open route, 'O'), farms have time windows ('TW'), and after collecting crops, trucks proceed to processing plants (backhaul 'B', as linehaul is completed first). These features correspond to 'O', 'B', and 'TW', making 'OVRPBTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 85
Description: A renewable energy company must service offshore wind turbines located in remote oceanic areas. Their vessels deliver maintenance parts (e.g., lubricants, components) to each turbine and collect scrap metal or outdated equipment for recycling. Each vessel has a limited capacity to carry both outbound supplies and inbound scrap. Routes must stay within a maximum travel distance to ensure safe return to the depot without refueling. The challenge is to plan efficient routes balancing delivery and pickup loads while covering all turbine sites.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles handling both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) at each turbine simultaneously, which aligns with Mixed Backhaul (MB). Additionally, there is a maximum travel distance constraint (L) to ensure safe return to the depot. No open route (O) or time window (TW) requirements are mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 98
Description: A city’s maintenance team delivers gardening tools, fertilizers, and equipment to city parks (linehaul) and collects litter and debris from designated areas (backhaul). Deliveries must precede pickups to avoid contamination. Vehicles have limited capacity, and routes are restricted by a distance limit to reduce fuel costs. The challenge is to optimize paths for servicing all parks efficiently while ensuring no vehicle exceeds its range or load capacity.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) where pickups must occur after deliveries, distance limits (L) on vehicle routes, and capacity constraints. Since the problem specifies that backhauls are only allowed after linehauls (B) and has distance restrictions (L), the most specific variant is VRPBL. The presence of B and L takes precedence over the capacity constraint (C). There is no mention of open routes (O), time windows (TW), or mixed backhauls (MB), so those are excluded.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 81
Description: Automotive dealerships require fresh parts (linehaul) to restock showrooms and need to return obsolete or defective parts (backhaul) for recycling. Each dealership operates within specific time windows based on staff availability and customer service hours. Delivery trucks have limited capacity to accommodate both new and scrap parts. Routes must not exceed a daily distance limit to ensure technicians can return to the central warehouse before closing. The challenge is optimizing routes to meet dealership schedules, prevent part shortages, and maximize vehicle utilization.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as obsolete parts need to be returned, time windows (TW) due to dealership-specific operating hours, and distance limits (L) to ensure trucks return to the warehouse. These features align with the 'VRPBLTW' variant, which combines backhaul, distance limits, and time window constraints. The absence of mixed backhaul (MB) or open routes (O) further confirms this choice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 92
Description: A renewable energy firm services offshore wind turbines by delivering repair kits (linehaul) and hauling away decommissioned turbine blades (backhaul). Maintenance must occur during tidal windows (time constraints) to access restricted zones, and vessels must return to port within 14 hours (duration limit) due to crew safety regulations. Each boat has limited capacity for both new parts and scrap materials, requiring precise load balancing.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) with linehaul and backhaul loads, time window constraints (TW) due to tidal access restrictions, and a requirement for vehicles to return to the depot (not open route). The 14-hour duration limit is interpreted as part of the route time constraints, aligning with TW. Mixed backhaul (MB) or distance limits (L) are not explicitly mentioned, making VRPBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 29
Description: An event planning company deploys trucks to deliver floral arrangements, linens, and decor to venues and later collect the items for reuse. Each vehicle (<capacity>) must handle both outbound deliveries (linehaul) and inbound pickups (backhaul) of used materials. Routes originate from the storage facility (<loc_depot>), visit multiple event locations in any order, and end at the last stop. The goal is to plan fuel-efficient paths that accommodate mixed cargo types without overloading trucks, while meeting clients’ setup and teardown timelines.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (ending at the last stop, not returning to the depot: "O"), mixed backhauls (simultaneous handling of linehaul and backhaul during the route, as routes can visit locations in any order: "MB"), and time window constraints (meeting setup/teardown timelines: "TW"). Capacity is mentioned but superseded by other features. Thus, the variant is OVRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 49
Description: A telecommunications company deploys submersibles to repair deep-sea internet cables. Crews must first deliver repair kits (<demand_linehaul>) to fault locations (<loc_customer>), then salvage damaged segments (<demand_backhaul>). Each repair window (<time_windows>) is dictated by ocean current patterns, with service taking <service_time> hours. Submersible vessels (capacity <capacity>) must complete repairs before surfacing within a <distance_limit> km radius of the support ship (<loc_depot>). The challenge is coordinating repair sequences, avoiding payload overloads, and meeting time-sensitive oceanic conditions.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as salvaging occurs after delivering repair kits, distance limits (L) due to the radius constraint, time windows (TW) from ocean current patterns, and open routes (O) since submersibles do not need to return to the depot but must surface within a radius. These features collectively align with the 'OVRPBLTW' variant, which combines Open VRP with Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 52
Description: A tech conference organizer requires trucks to deliver demo units and booth materials to exhibitors (linehaul) and collect returned equipment after the event (backhaul). Time windows are critical: installations must be completed before the conference opens, and teardowns must occur after closing hours. Trucks must sequence deliveries and pickups flexibly to handle variable payloads (e.g., heavy servers vs. lightweight peripherals) within capacity constraints, ensuring no delays in setup or teardown while minimizing transit costs.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands with critical time windows for deliveries and pickups. Since backhaul (B) and time windows (TW) are explicitly mentioned, and backhaul can only be addressed after linehaul (due to time window constraints), the most specific variant is VRPBTW. Capacity constraints are present but are secondary to B and TW according to the classification rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 92
Description: A catering company services multiple festivals and corporate events, requiring precise timing. Trucks must deliver perishable food items (linehaul) to event venues by their start times and then collect unused equipment (backhaul) after the events conclude. Each venue imposes strict time windows: deliveries must arrive 2 hours pre-event, while pickups must occur within 1 hour post-event. Vehicle capacities are constrained by refrigeration space for food and equipment storage. All routes must stay within a 150km radius to allow round trips before dusk, ensuring compliance with safety regulations and avoiding overnight operations.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) with strict time windows (TW) for both deliveries and pickups, vehicle distance limits (L) due to the 150km radius constraint, and requires linehaul to be completed before backhaul. There is no indication of open routes (O) since vehicles need to return within the radius for round trips. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 68
Description: An event management company needs to deploy modular booth structures, displays, and promotional materials to trade show venues (linehaul) and later dismantle them (backhaul). Each venue imposes time windows for setup (before the event) and teardown (post-event), requiring trucks to manage payloads of heavy exhibits and fragile items without overloading, while minimizing idle time during setup periods.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deployment) and backhaul (dismantling), with the requirement that backhaul can only occur after linehaul is completed. Additionally, time windows are imposed for setup and teardown at venues. The presence of backhaul (B) and time windows (TW) directly aligns with the VRPBTW variant. There is no explicit mention of open routes (O) or distance limits (L), so these are excluded.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 25
Description: A renewable energy firm must deploy new solar inverters to remote farms (<loc_customer>) while collecting expired panels for recycling. Delivery trucks (<capacity> kg) start at a depot (<loc_depot>), must complete installations before dusk (<time_windows>). Farmers require service between 8 AM–2 PM to avoid heat stress, and inverters weigh <demand_linehaul> kg. Recycling pickups (<demand_backhaul>) must follow deliveries, as panels cannot be mixed with live equipment. Each route is capped at <distance_limit> km to ensure drivers reach before sunset.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW) for customer service (8 AM–2 PM), backhaul (B) constraints where pickups must follow deliveries, and distance limits (L) on routes. The presence of these three features (B, L, TW) corresponds to the VRPBLTW variant. There is no indication of open routes (O) or mixed backhaul (MB).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 46
Description: A festival organizer needs to transport stages, lighting, and sound equipment (linehaul) to multiple event sites and later collect all materials (backhaul) for reuse. Trucks depart from a central depot, serve several venues in any order, and end their routes at the last site. The challenge is to plan open routes that maximize equipment utilization without overloading vehicles and minimize total travel costs.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) where vehicles do not return to the depot and backhaul (B) demands that are satisfied after linehaul. The requirement to collect materials (backhaul) after delivering equipment (linehaul) aligns with the 'B' constraint. The absence of time windows (TW), distance limits (L), or mixed backhaul (MB) rules out other variants. Capacity is implied but secondary to O and B.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 98
Description: A wedding planning company transports floral arrangements, seating, and decor to venues before ceremonies, with strict setup time windows. After events, all items must be collected. Vehicles must deliver decor (linehaul) within time constraints, then return later to pick up items (backhaul), ensuring deliveries precede pickups. Capacity limits and timing are critical to avoid delays and logistical bottlenecks.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (B) where items must be collected after deliveries are completed, and time window (TW) constraints for deliveries. The strict setup time windows and requirement for deliveries to precede pickups align with the VRPBTW variant. Capacity is mentioned but superseded by the presence of B and TW features.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 39
Description: A tent rental company provides temporary structures for corporate events, weddings, and festivals. Tents must be delivered to venues hours before the event starts (setup window) and collected within 24 hours post-event (teardown window). Trucks must transport tents (linehaul) and haul away waste or damaged materials (backhaul), respecting capacity limits on both weight and space. The challenge is to coordinate deliveries and pickups across diverse locations and time constraints while minimizing fuel use and vehicle idle time.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) with the requirement that backhauls can only occur after the event, which aligns with backhaul (B). Additionally, setup and teardown time windows (TW) are specified. Capacity constraints exist but are secondary to B and TW. There is no indication of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhauls (MB). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 72
Description: A conference organizer hires a logistics firm to deliver audiovisual equipment (projectors, screens) to multiple event venues (linehaul) and later retrieve it post-event (backhaul). Each venue has strict setup and teardown time windows tied to speaker schedules and audience arrival times. Trucks must prioritize high-priority venues while managing the bulk and fragility of equipment within their cargo limits.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul demands (delivery and retrieval of equipment) with time window constraints at each venue. The requirement to deliver first (linehaul) and retrieve later (backhaul) aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) classification. The strict setup and teardown time windows tied to schedules necessitate 'TW' (time window constraints). There is no mention of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhaul (MB), making 'VRPBTW' the most specific variant.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 70
Description: Museums and galleries must transport valuable artworks to temporary exhibition sites and later collect them for return. Each artwork has strict time windows for installation and removal to align with exhibit schedules. Delivery trucks must carry fragile items (linehaul) while also collecting empty crates or returned pieces (backhaul) from previous locations. Vehicles have limited capacity to ensure safe handling of art. Routes must stay within distance limits to avoid overworking drivers, with final stops concluding at the farthest exhibition site rather than returning to the depot. Time windows enforce that artworks arrive just before installation and are picked up post-exhibition without delays.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at the farthest site, backhaul (B) with linehaul and return collections, distance limits (L) to avoid driver overwork, and strict time windows (TW) for installations and removals. The combination of O, B, L, and TW aligns with the OVRPBLTW variant.

Description: A maritime logistics provider supplies cruise ships in port with provisions (e.g., food, spare parts) and collects waste (e.g., recyclables, hazardous materials). Each service truck (<capacity> tons) starts at a port depot (<loc_depot>), must align with ship docking schedules (<time_windows>), and adhere to a 50 km distance limit (<distance_limit>) due to limited fuel. The mixed backhaul process requires delivering supplies first and then collecting waste, with routes ending at the final ship berth to avoid empty return trips. Service times (<service_time>) depend on ship crew availability.
Reason: The problem description includes open routes (vehicles end at the final ship berth, so 'O'), backhaul demands with a strict order of delivery then collection ('B'), a distance limit ('L'), and time window constraints ('TW'). These features collectively align with the 'OVRPBLTW' variant, which combines open routes, backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: After a natural disaster, relief organizations must deliver essential supplies to affected areas and collect hazardous waste from contaminated sites. Vehicles depart from a central warehouse, first delivering medical kits, food, and water (linehaul) to disaster zones (must arrive within specific time windows to prioritize urgent needs). After deliveries, they proceed to collect medical waste or debris (backhaul) from designated sites. Each vehicle has a limited capacity, ensuring supplies and waste do not exceed the load. Routes must stay within a maximum distance to avoid overextending teams, and deliveries must precede pickups to ensure timely aid distribution. The goal is to minimize travel distance while adhering to time constraints and operational limits.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles that must first deliver supplies (linehaul) within specific time windows (TW) and then collect hazardous waste (backhaul, B) with a requirement that deliveries precede pickups. Additionally, routes have a maximum distance limit (L). These elements correspond to the B (backhaul), L (distance limits), and TW (time windows) attributes. There is no mention of open routes (O) or mixed backhaul (MB), so the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.

Description: A national postal service must deliver packages to residential customers and collect returned items for redistribution. Delivery trucks (with <capacity> kg capacity) start and end at a central depot <loc_depot>. Linehaul stops (deliveries) must occur before backhaul stops (pickups). Each customer has a time window <time_windows> for service (e.g., daytime availability), and drivers cannot exceed an 8-hour shift (<duration_limit>). The challenge is to minimize route distances while ensuring all deliveries are completed before pickups and adhering to strict shift constraints.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul constraints (B) where deliveries must precede pickups, time windows (TW) for customer service, and a duration limit which is a form of time constraint. Since there are no mentions of distance limits (L), open routes (O), or mixed backhauls (MB), the most specific variant combining backhaul and time window constraints is VRPBTW.

A central depot must deliver fresh ingredients to each truck’s temporary location within their operating hours. Delivery vehicles have limited refrigerated capacity and must plan routes under a daily distance limit to service all trucks efficiently without exceeding driver shift durations.
Reason: The problem involves time window constraints (each truck must be serviced during their operating hours), distance limits (delivery vehicles must plan routes under a daily distance limit), and open routes (vehicles do not need to return to the depot, as the focus is on servicing all trucks efficiently). The presence of 'O' (open route), 'L' (distance limits), and 'TW' (time windows) makes 'OVRPLTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 4
Description: A city’s waste management team collects recyclables and organic waste from households (backhaul) and delivers compost to community gardens (linehaul). Trucks have a capacity limit and must operate within a set daily distance to avoid overextension. Routes originate at the processing facility but terminate at the final stop, balancing environmental goals with logistical efficiency.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (terminate at final stop, 'O'), backhaul demands (collecting recyclables/organic waste) that can only be satisfied after linehaul (delivering compost, 'B'), and distance limits ('L'). These attributes align with the 'OVRPBL' variant, which combines open routes, backhaul constraints, and distance limitations. Capacity is mentioned but is secondary to these features.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 93
Description: A retail distributor redistributes fresh stock to <num_customer> stores while collecting returned items. Trucks start at a distribution center (<loc_depot>), serving stores during their operating hours (<time_windows>). Each route must carry new inventory (<demand_linehaul>) and returned goods (<demand_backhaul>), ensuring total load stays under <capacity> kg. Distance limits (<distance_limit> km) prevent drivers from overextending their daily routes, ending at the last store visited. The aim is to minimize travel while meeting strict inventory deadlines and return logistics.
Reason: The problem includes open routes (O) as trucks end at the last store, backhaul (B) due to the collection of returned goods, distance limits (L), and time windows (TW) for store service. These features correspond to the OVRPBLTW variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 88
Description: A marathon organizer requires water stations to be deployed across a city’s race route before the event and retrieved afterward. Each station location has a strict deployment deadline (TW) and a retrieval window post-race. Delivery trucks (capacity <capacity>) must handle both setup (linehaul) and cleanup (backhaul), ensuring no vehicle exceeds its capacity. Routes end at the final pickup point (O), minimizing idle time between tasks while meeting athlete hydration needs.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at the final pickup point, backhaul (B) for retrieval after linehaul, and time windows (TW) for deployment and retrieval deadlines. There is no mention of mixed backhaul (MB) or distance limits (L), making "OVRPBTW" the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 29
Description: A luxury spa chain requires fresh linens and amenities (linehaul) delivered to villas for guest arrivals, while simultaneously collecting soiled linens and hazardous skincare waste (backhaul). Each villa has strict service time windows (TW) tied to guest check-in/out schedules. Vehicles (<capacity> kg) must balance payloads: e.g., a truck might first deliver towels to a morning check-in (linehaul), then backtrack to collect waste from a departing guest’s villa (backhaul), ensuring no overloads.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (collections) with time window constraints (TW). The example indicates that backhauls are performed after linehauls (B), and each villa has strict service time windows. There is no mention of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhauls (MB), so the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 81
Description: During a severe drought, a water utility company must deliver full water tanks to parched communities while retrieving empty ones for refilling. The depot (<loc_depot>) sends trucks with a <capacity> liter capacity to <num_customer> distribution points. Each site requires a specific volume of water (<demand_linehaul>) and has a quota of empty tanks to return (<demand_backhaul>). Routes must balance both tasks without exceeding weight limits, as tanks are heavy when full. To prevent overextension, each truck’s round-trip distance cannot exceed <distance_limit> kilometers, ensuring rapid redistribution cycles and minimal downtime for refilling operations.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering water) and backhaul (retrieving empty tanks) demands, which must be balanced in routes (B). Additionally, trucks have a round-trip distance limit (L). There is no mention of time windows (TW), mixed backhaul (MB), or open routes (O), as trucks return to the depot (round-trip). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 30
Description: Airport ground crews must deliver cargo to departing flights and collect luggage from arriving flights using vehicles with a <capacity> ton limit. Each flight specifies strict time windows for cargo loading (before departure) and luggage unloading (after arrival). Vehicles can intermingle deliveries and pickups in any sequence but must ensure total cargo + luggage weight never exceeds capacity. For instance, a truck might first collect scrap metal from a landed flight (backhaul), then deliver fresh produce to a departing cargo plane (linehaul), all while adhering to each location’s time window.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as vehicles can intermingle deliveries and pickups, time windows (TW) for cargo and luggage handling, and open routes (O) since there's no mention of vehicles returning to the depot. Capacity (C) is present but secondary to these features. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBTW (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 82
Description: A Christmas tree retailer must deliver fresh trees to customer homes before December 20th (linehaul) and collect discarded trees for recycling by January 10th (backhaul). Delivery time windows are set by customer availability, while pickups must occur after New Year’s Day. The fleet’s <capacity> cubic meters must accommodate both compact tree deliveries and bulky post-holiday pickups. Trucks end their routes at the final stop of each day to minimize idle return journeys.
Reason: The problem involves an open route (trucks end at the final stop, not returning to the depot: "O"), backhaul demand (separate pickup after linehaul: "B"), and time window constraints for both deliveries and pickups ("TW"). The capacity constraint is present but secondary to these features. No mixed backhaul (MB) or distance limits (L) are mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 82
Description: A meal kit startup delivers fresh groceries to urban households while collecting food waste for composting. Delivery vehicles must carry perishables (linehaul) and empty containers for organic waste (backhaul). Capacity constraints balance the weight of groceries and waste. Routes originate from a central kitchen but terminate at the final stop to optimize efficiency. Time windows ensure meals arrive before lunch/dinner hours, while distance limits prevent spoilage from prolonged travel. The system also enforces strict service times to accommodate customers’ schedules.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, backhaul (B) for collecting waste, distance limits (L) to prevent spoilage, and time windows (TW) for customer schedules. These features align with the OVRPBLTW variant, which combines all four constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 18
Description: A construction equipment rental company delivers machinery to job sites and retrieves it afterward. Vehicles must handle mixed tasks: delivering equipment (linehaul) and collecting it post-use (backhaul). Routes must stay within a maximum distance to minimize fuel costs and ensure equipment availability for nearby projects, while respecting truck capacity limits for both outgoing and returning loads.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands (B) with backhaul tasks occurring post-use, indicating they are handled after linehaul. The vehicles have maximum distance constraints (L). Although capacity is mentioned, it is superseded by the presence of B and L. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O), so the most specific variant is VRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 67
Description: A food truck network requires fresh cooking equipment and supplies (linehaul) to be delivered to bustling city locations, while simultaneously collecting used cooking oil and waste materials (backhaul). Each delivery truck can carry up to <capacity> kg, and routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius of the central kitchen to ensure timely returns. The solution must balance load distribution and route efficiency to minimize fuel costs and environmental impact.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as both linehaul and backhaul can be handled simultaneously, distance limits (L) due to the radius constraint, and no requirement for vehicles to return to the depot (O) is mentioned. Time windows (TW) are not specified. The presence of MB and L makes VRPMBL the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 87
Description: Farmers require upgraded irrigation systems to improve crop yields, while also needing to recycle outdated components. A rural logistics provider must deliver new pumps, pipes, and valves to farms while collecting obsolete parts for recycling. Vehicles are constrained by weight limits that must factor in both the heavy new equipment and the lighter old parts. Routes begin at the agricultural supply depot (<loc_depot>), visit farms for deliveries or pickups in any sequence, and conclude at the last site visited. The objective is to minimize total travel distance while avoiding overloading trucks and ensuring timely service to farmers.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (ending at the last site, not returning to the depot), mixed backhaul (simultaneous delivery and pickup of goods), and time windows ('timely service' implies time constraints). Weight limits are a capacity constraint, but 'C' is ignored when other features like 'O', 'MB', or 'TW' are present. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 88
Description: A tool rental service delivers specialized equipment (e.g., heavy machinery, precision tools) to industrial sites and retrieves them post-use. Each truck has a capacity limit for both outgoing tools and incoming returned items. Routes must visit all rental sites without exceeding a maximum distance to ensure efficient fuel usage. The goal is to balance delivery and retrieval loads while minimizing total travel distance.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as both delivery and retrieval loads need to be balanced during the routes, and distance limits (L) due to the maximum travel distance constraint for fuel efficiency. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O). The presence of MB and L makes VRPMBL the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 37
Description: An airline caterer must deliver pre-packed meals to aircraft before departure and collect used trays and leftover food after landing. Each flight has a tight time window: meals must be loaded within 2 hours before takeoff, and trays must be retrieved within 1 hour post-landing. Trucks must carry both fresh meals (linehaul) and return waste (backhaul) without exceeding weight limits, navigating airport traffic and gate changes. The aim is to minimize delays while adhering to stringent food safety and operational timelines.
Reason: The problem involves both time window constraints (TW) for meal delivery and tray collection, as well as backhaul (B) operations where trucks must collect waste after delivering meals. Each flight's delivery must occur within a specific time window before departure, and collection within a window after landing, fitting the 'TW' and 'B' requirements. The need to handle backhaul (waste collection) after linehaul (meal delivery) aligns with the 'B' classification (not mixed, since linehaul must precede backhaul). There is no indication of open routes (O), mixed backhaul (MB), or distance limits (L). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 7
Description: An online retailer uses public lockers (<num_customer> locations) for deliveries and returns. Customers expect packages within specific time windows (<time_windows>), and return slots must be reserved. Delivery trucks (<capacity> kg capacity) start from the warehouse (<loc_depot>), mix drop-offs and pickups in any order, and cannot travel beyond <distance_limit> km per route. The goal is to minimize delays while respecting locker availability times and vehicle constraints.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW), mixed backhaul (MB) due to simultaneous drop-offs and pickups in any order, distance limits (L), and open routes (O) as vehicles start from the depot but are not required to return. The combination of O, MB, L, and TW makes OVRPMBLTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 99
Description: A utility provider replaces old meters with new smart meters. Technicians deliver new meters (linehaul) to customer sites (<loc_customer>) and collect outdated ones (backhaul). Vehicles start from a depot (<loc_depot>), with capacity constraints (<capacity>) for both meters and collected equipment. Routes are open-ended, concluding at the last customer. Distance limits (<distance_limit>) ensure coverage within service regions. Customers have time windows (<time_windows>) for meter installation, often tied to billing cycles or scheduled technician availability.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles conclude at the last customer, backhaul (B) due to collecting outdated meters, distance limits (L) for service regions, and time windows (TW) tied to installations. These features correspond to the 'OVRPBLTW' variant, which combines open routes, backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 81
Description: A civil engineering firm must deploy teams to install floodgates in vulnerable areas before predicted storm surges (<time_windows>). Each site requires specific materials (<demand>), and vehicles (<capacity> ton capacity) must start from a central depot (<loc_depot>). Due to limited fuel and road accessibility, routes must not exceed <distance_limit> km. Teams must arrive at each location within critical timeframes to prevent catastrophic flooding.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints (<time_windows> and "critical timeframes") and vehicle distance limits (<distance_limit> km). While capacity constraints (<capacity> ton) are present, the presence of L (distance limits) and TW (time windows) takes precedence. There is no mention of backhaul (B) or open routes (O), so the most specific variant is VRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 26
Description: A company rents out projectors and AV equipment to businesses for events. Deliveries (linehaul) must arrive before client events start (TW), and pickups (backhaul) must occur after events end. Each location has specific time windows for service. Vehicles must balance outgoing equipment and returned items within capacity limits. The objective is optimized routes to reduce costs and ensure timely service.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW) for both deliveries and pickups, as each location has specific service time constraints. Additionally, backhauls (B) are required for pickups after events end, but these pickups are not strictly required to follow all linehauls (deliveries) since they are tied to individual event end times, allowing mixed backhaul (MB) handling. This satisfies the "VRPMBTW" variant (VRP with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 79
Description: A drone rental service delivers survey drones to construction sites for topographic mapping and retrieves them afterward. Each site has a delivery window before survey operations begin and a pickup window after completion. Delivery trucks must first transport drones (linehaul) to all locations, then return to collect them (backhaul). Capacity limits restrict the number of drones per truck, and routes are constrained by distance to cover regional projects efficiently. All deliveries must arrive before survey starts, and pickups must occur after project deadlines.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as drones must be delivered (linehaul) and then picked up (backhaul) after project deadlines. Distance constraints (L) are mentioned as routes are limited by distance. Time windows (TW) are specified for both deliveries (before survey starts) and pickups (after project deadlines). These features align with the VRPBLTW variant, which combines backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 96
Description: A humanitarian organization sets up temporary medical camps in remote regions. Teams must deliver medical supplies (linehaul) to camp locations (<loc_customer>) and later retrieve used equipment (backhaul) for redistribution. Vehicles originate from a central depot (<loc_depot>) and do not return, ending routes at the final camp. Each vehicle has a capacity limit (<capacity>) for both supplies and equipment. Distance limits (<distance_limit>) ensure vehicles don’t exceed operational range. Camps require setup by specific deadlines (<time_windows>), with retrieval scheduled after patient care concludes.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, backhaul (B) for retrieving equipment after linehaul deliveries, distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW) for camp setup deadlines. These features correspond to the 'OVRPBLTW' variant, which explicitly includes all mentioned constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 81
Description: A tech firm deploys demo units to global trade shows and collects them afterward. Each demo unit includes heavy hardware and sensitive components. Trade shows impose strict setup and teardown time windows, requiring precise synchronization of deliveries and pickups. Routes must balance the weight of outbound shipments (loaded with demo units) and inbound pickups (empty units) without exceeding vehicle capacities. The challenge includes optimizing the sequence of stops to minimize idle time and ensure units are available for subsequent events.
Reason: The problem involves both deliveries (outbound shipments) and pickups (inbound empty units), which aligns with backhaul (B). Additionally, strict setup and teardown time windows at trade shows impose time window constraints (TW). Since the pickups logically occur after deliveries (as units must be deployed before being collected), this follows the backhaul sequencing (B) rather than mixed backhaul (MB). The presence of both B and TW makes VRPBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 78
Description: A car rental company delivers vehicles to customers and schedules pickups for maintenance or repairs. Each delivery truck carries rented cars (<demand_linehaul>), while pickups collect returned vehicles and faulty parts (<demand_backhaul>). Customers specify preferred pickup/delivery times (<time_windows>), and trucks must adhere to their <capacity> vehicle limit. Routes begin at the rental depot (<loc_depot>) but end at the last customer location, streamlining operations and reducing fuel costs.
Reason: The problem description includes open routes (O) as trucks end at the last customer location, backhaul demand (B) with pickups of returned vehicles and faulty parts, and time window constraints (TW) specified by customers. These features correspond to the OVRPBTW variant, which combines open routes, backhaul, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 67
Description: A sports logistics firm must deliver water stations, portable toilets, and first-aid kits to designated marathon routes (linehaul) before the race and collect all materials immediately after the event (backhaul). Each location has strict time windows for setup and teardown to avoid disrupting traffic, and trucks must optimize routes to handle perishable supplies and bulky equipment within capacity limits.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (collections), with strict time windows for setup and teardown. This corresponds to the Backhaul (B) and Time Window (TW) constraints. Since the vehicles must handle deliveries first and collections after, and there are no indications of open routes (O), mixed backhauls (MB), or distance limits (L), the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 22
Description: A healthcare provider rents specialized medical devices (e.g., wheelchairs, monitors) to patients and schedules pickups after their recovery. Delivery trucks (<capacity> devices) must first deliver equipment to patients’ homes (<time_windows>) before returning to collect devices from others. Each route is restricted to a 7-hour duration (<duration_limit>), and vehicles must not exceed their capacity during combined delivery and pickup loads. The solution must balance urgency of deliveries with efficient backhaul scheduling.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) since devices must be picked up after deliveries, time windows (TW) for deliveries, and vehicles have a duration limit which can be associated with route constraints. However, the provided definitions do not explicitly include duration limits, so only B and TW are considered. The routes require delivering first (backhaul), so VRPBTW is the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 71
Description: A grocery chain operates in a city, delivering fresh produce to stores (linehaul) and collecting food waste for composting (backhaul). Deliveries must occur before stores open (TW), while pickups happen after closing hours (TW). Trucks (C) are limited in size to fit city streets, and routes must not exceed municipal distance limits (L) to reduce emissions. Drivers begin at the central depot, deliver produce, then collect waste, concluding at the depot for processing—without redundant returns to reduce fuel use.
Reason: The problem includes Backhaul (B) with separate linehaul and backhaul operations, Distance Limits (L) for routes, and Time Window (TW) constraints for both deliveries and pickups. The vehicles must return to the depot, so Open Route (O) does not apply. Mixed Backhaul (MB) is not mentioned, as linehaul and backhaul are sequential. Thus, VRPBLTW is the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 73
Description: A pop-up retail chain opens temporary stores in shopping districts. Logistics teams deliver seasonal merchandise (linehaul) to these stores and collect returned items (backhaul) for redistribution or restocking. Stores have limited operational hours (time windows), requiring precise timing to avoid missed pickup/delivery windows. Trucks must optimize routes to handle fluctuating inventory demands while ensuring vehicles aren’t overloaded with mixed product types.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (B) for collecting returned items and time windows (TW) due to stores' limited operational hours. The description does not mention mixed backhaul (MB), open routes (O), or distance limits (L), making VRPBTW the most specific variant that accounts for backhaul and time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 82
Description: A logistics provider delivers stalls, equipment, and supplies (linehaul) to farmers' markets, which must arrive before setup begins (TW). After markets close, trucks collect waste, disassembled stalls, and unsold produce (backhaul). Vehicles have capacity constraints for mixed cargo and must return to the depot within a set distance limit to ensure timely cleanup. The goal is to coordinate deliveries and pickups efficiently while adhering to market operating hours and avoiding overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as trucks collect waste and unsold produce after markets close, distance limits (L) as vehicles must return within a set distance, and time windows (TW) for both deliveries (before setup) and pickups (after closure). These features align with the VRPBLTW variant, which combines backhaul, distance limits, and time window constraints. Capacity constraints are present but secondary to these features.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 93
Description: A telecom provider upgrades rural internet infrastructure by deploying 5G equipment (linehaul) and collecting outdated antennas (backhaul). Sites require installation during maintenance windows (time windows) to avoid service disruptions. Technicians have an 8-hour working shift (duration limit), and trucks must prioritize deliveries before pickups to prevent blocking access to tower sites. Capacity constraints demand careful scheduling to avoid overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (B) demands where deliveries (linehaul) must be completed before pickups (backhaul) to prevent blocking access, and time window (TW) constraints for installations during maintenance windows. The presence of B and TW makes VRPBTW the most specific variant. Capacity (C) is mentioned but ignored due to the presence of B and TW. There is no indication of open routes (O) or distance limits (L).

Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 2
Description: A furniture retailer operates a "trade-in" program where customers receive new furniture deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) and simultaneously have old furniture picked up (<demand_backhaul>). Delivery trucks start from the main warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering new items to households, then collecting discarded furniture from other customers. The trucks must never exceed their weight capacity (<capacity>), and pickups can only occur after all deliveries on the route are finalized. The challenge is to balance load distribution and route efficiency to reduce total driving distance while ensuring timely service for both delivery and recycling requests.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) that must be satisfied after all linehaul deliveries are completed, as stated in the description. Capacity constraints (C) are present but are secondary to the backhaul classification. There is no explicit mention of open routes (O), distance limits (L), time windows (TW), or mixed backhauls (MB), making VRPB the most specific variant.

Description: A film production company must deliver heavy equipment (cameras, lighting) to multiple shoot locations (<loc_customer>) and collect gear after filming wraps. Vehicles start from a storage facility (<loc_depot>), with capacity constraints (<capacity>) for both deliveries and pickups. Routes are open-ended, terminating at the final shoot site. Distance limits (<distance_limit>) prevent excessive travel between locations. Time windows (<time_windows>) align with filming schedules, requiring precise arrival times for setup and retrieval.
Reason: The problem specifies open routes (O) as vehicles terminate at the final location, backhaul (B) for collecting gear after deliveries, distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). These features align with the 'OVRPBLTW' variant, which combines open routes, backhaul, distance constraints, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 73
Description: Health organizations deploy mobile clinics to rural areas with limited healthcare access. Each clinic requires medical supplies (linehaul) and must later collect biohazard waste (backhaul) for disposal. Clinics have strict operational time windows to coincide with community outreach hours. Vehicles must stay under weight limits for both supplies and waste. Routes are planned to reach remote villages within a single-day distance limit, with drivers concluding their shift at the last serviced site. This ensures equitable coverage without excessive travel.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at the last site, backhaul (B) for waste collection after linehaul, distance limits (L) for single-day reachability, and time windows (TW) for clinic operations. These features correspond to the 'OVRPBLTW' variant, which combines all these constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 96
Description: A humanitarian organization uses drones to deliver medical kits (<demand> kg) to flood-stricken villages (<loc_customer>). Each village requires supplies by a specific time (<TW>) to treat urgent cases, but drone batteries (<capacity> kg payload) and flight ranges are limited. Drones depart from a central command center (<loc_depot>), and after their final drop-off, they remain deployed to assist local teams instead of returning. Routes must balance payload limits with tight delivery deadlines while optimizing flight paths.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as drones do not return to the depot after their final delivery, time window constraints (TW) for deliveries, and distance limits (L) due to limited flight ranges. Capacity (C) is present but superseded by O, L, and TW. The combination of O, L, and TW makes OVRPLTW the most specific variant.

Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 53
Description: A hospital’s logistics team must deliver fresh linens to patient wards (linehaul) and collect contaminated waste from surgical and clinical areas (backhaul). Time windows are tied to shift changes and infection control protocols, requiring deliveries before morning shifts and pickups after evening rounds. Vehicles must balance the volume of clean linens and biohazard waste without exceeding capacity, ensuring compliance with health regulations while synchronizing routes with staff schedules to avoid operational disruptions.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) with time windows (TW) tied to shift changes. Deliveries must occur before morning shifts (linehaul time windows) and pickups after evening rounds (backhaul time windows), indicating a sequential requirement (B). The vehicles must balance loads without exceeding capacity, but since B and TW are present, the capacity (C) is not explicitly included in the variant code. There is no mention of open routes (O) or distance limits (L), so VRPBTW is the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 36
Description: A floral distributor delivers fresh bouquets to grocery stores and flower shops daily, with strict time windows to maintain freshness. Each stop requires a <demand_linehaul> kg delivery of flowers and a <demand_backhaul> kg pickup of empty crates for reuse. Trucks cannot exceed <capacity> kg total load (flowers + crates) and must return to the depot within a <distance_limit> km range to ensure overnight restocking. Time windows align with store opening hours, demanding precise routing to avoid late deliveries or missed crate pickups.
Reason: The problem includes mixed backhaul (MB) as each stop requires both delivery and pickup, distance limits (L) for the trucks, and time window constraints (TW) aligned with store hours. Since all three features are present and the route requires returning to the depot, the most specific variant is VRPMBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 84
Description: A network of temporary farmers' markets requires daily setup (linehaul deliveries of stalls, produce, and equipment) and post-event inventory retrieval (backhaul pickups of unsold goods). Markets operate within strict operating hours (e.g., 8:00 AM–2:00 PM), so deliveries must arrive by 7:30 AM, and pickups must occur by 2:30 PM. Trucks must balance the volume of setup materials and perishable returns within their <capacity> cubic meters. Drivers finish at the last market location to streamline logistics and reduce fuel costs.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as drivers finish at the last market, backhaul (B) for post-event pickups after linehaul deliveries, and time windows (TW) for deliveries (by 7:30 AM) and pickups (by 2:30 PM). Capacity constraints exist but are superseded by the presence of O, B, and TW. The variant OVRPBTW best captures these combined requirements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 78
Description: A recycling firm delivers empty bins to businesses and collects filled ones weekly. Each client specifies time windows for deliveries and pickups. Trucks must first distribute empty bins (linehaul) before returning to collect the waste (backhaul). Capacity limits depend on bin sizes, and routes cannot exceed a distance threshold to ensure same-day service. The company must coordinate deliveries and pickups to meet business schedules without overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) with linehaul and backhaul demands requiring specific order, time windows (TW) for both deliveries and pickups, and distance limits (L) on routes. These elements align with the VRPBLTW variant, which combines backhaul, distance constraints, and time windows.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 83
Description: A festival organizer must set up temporary stages, lighting, and equipment at multiple locations before an event and dismantle them afterward. Delivery trucks (linehaul) transport equipment to venues, while the same routes later pick up used materials (backhaul). Each vehicle’s capacity limits the combined weight of equipment and waste. Routes are open-ended, ending at the final venue to avoid redundant trips. Time windows enforce setup completion before the event starts and teardown after it ends. Distance limits ensure vehicles can traverse rugged terrain without exceeding fuel or battery ranges.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at the final venue, backhaul (B) with distinct linehaul and backhaul phases, distance limits (L) due to rugged terrain, and time windows (TW) for setup and teardown. These attributes correspond to the OVRPBLTW variant, which explicitly includes open routes, backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.

Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 91
Description: A live event production company rents out equipment (e.g., stages, lighting) to venues for concerts and festivals. Deliveries must occur before setup deadlines, and pickups must align with post-event curfews. Trucks have limited capacity for both outbound equipment and inbound returns. Routes are designed to terminate at the final pickup location to streamline operations. The challenge is to plan efficient routes that respect time windows while avoiding overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles terminate at the final pickup location, not returning to the depot — "O"), backhaul constraints (pickups must occur after deliveries, aligning with post-event curfews — "B"), and time windows for deliveries and pickups (setup deadlines and curfews — "TW"). While capacity constraints exist, the presence of "O", "B", and "TW" takes precedence over "C".

Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 82
Description: A semiconductor manufacturer relies on just-in-time delivery of fragile components (<demand>) to multiple fabrication plants (<loc_customer>). Delivery trucks (<capacity> kg capacity) must depart from a logistics hub (<loc_depot>), adhering to stringent time windows (<time_windows>) to avoid production halts. Routes must also respect <distance_limit> km limits to prevent overheating of climate-controlled cargo compartments.
Reason: The problem includes capacity constraints (C), time windows (TW), and distance limits (L). However, since TW and L are present, the C is ignored. The problem does not mention backhaul (B), mixed backhaul (MB), or open routes (O). Therefore, the most specific variant combining distance limits (L) and time windows (TW) is VRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 27
Description: A medical supply company transports oxygen cylinders to hospitals and healthcare facilities (<loc_customer>) while collecting empty cylinders for refilling. The depot (<loc_depot>) sends out vehicles with limited capacity (<capacity>), which must accommodate both full cylinders (linehaul) and returning empties (backhaul). Routes are open-ended, terminating at the last customer location, and must adhere to distance constraints (<distance_limit>) to ensure rapid service in emergencies.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles terminate at the last customer, backhaul (B) due to the collection of empty cylinders after delivering full ones, and distance constraints (L) to ensure rapid service. No time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB) are mentioned, making OVRPBL the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 74
Description: A farm services company delivers pesticides (linehaul) to rural farms during planting windows (TW) and collects empty containers (backhaul) for recycling. Trucks (C) must handle hazardous materials carefully, adhering to strict capacity limits. Routes are limited by distance (L) to cover remote areas efficiently. Drivers begin at the depot, supply pesticides, then retrieve containers, concluding at the depot for recycling—preventing environmental contamination and reducing travel redundancy.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as empty containers are collected after delivering pesticides, distance limits (L) due to route constraints, and time windows (TW) for planting windows. The trucks must start and end at the depot (not open route), and backhaul is handled only after linehaul. The combination of B, L, and TW makes VRPBLTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 17
Description: A medical logistics company delivers temperature-sensitive medications to hospitals and clinics while collecting expired or recalled drugs for safe disposal. Each healthcare facility has a critical time window for receiving deliveries (to maintain cold-chain integrity) and submitting returns. Vehicles must balance the capacity required for perishable goods and pickups, with routes concluding at the final served location. Compliance with time windows ensures drug efficacy and regulatory adherence.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles do not return to the depot), backhaul demands (collecting returns after deliveries), and time window constraints for both deliveries and returns. The combination of these features aligns with the OVRPBTW variant, as "B" (backhaul) and "TW" (time windows) are explicitly required, and "O" (open route) is specified since routes end at the final location.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 72
Description: A home appliance retailer offers a service to upgrade customers’ appliances (e.g., refrigerators, ovens) while recycling their old units. Delivery trucks must carry both new appliances (linehaul) and collect old appliances (backhaul) without exceeding vehicle capacity. Customers specify time windows for service (e.g., weekend availability), and routes can mix deliveries and pickups in any sequence. The goal is to minimize travel distance while ensuring all customers receive their new appliances and old units are retrieved for recycling promptly.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) since deliveries and pickups can be sequenced freely, time windows (TW) due to customer-specified service times, and vehicle capacity constraints. The presence of MB and TW makes 'VRPMBTW' the most specific variant, as other attributes like open routes (O) or distance limits (L) are not mentioned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 72
Description: A construction firm requires timely material delivery (linehaul) to active sites and waste pickup (backhaul) post-work hours. Each site has strict access times (TW) for deliveries and pickups. Trucks (C) must carry heavy loads without exceeding weight limits. Routes are restricted by daily distance limits (L) to prevent driver fatigue. Starting from the depot, crews first supply materials, then collect debris, ending at the depot for waste disposal—ensuring compliance with site schedules and safety protocols.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) with time windows (TW) and distance limits (L). The trucks must handle linehaul first (deliveries) and backhaul (waste pickup) after, adhering to site access times (TW) and daily distance constraints (L). Since all three constraints (B, L, TW) are present and the routes start and end at the depot (excluding "O"), the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 75
Description: Wind farm operators must deliver replacement parts to offshore turbines and collect decommissioned components for recycling. Each service vessel has a <capacity> ton capacity for carrying both new parts (<demand_linehaul>) and old scrap metal (<demand_backhaul>). Turbines are spread across coastal locations (<loc_customer>), each requiring maintenance within strict <time_windows> to avoid disrupting energy production. Vessels must complete their routes within a <distance_limit> nautical mile radius to ensure safe return before fuel depletion. Technicians can sequence deliveries and pickups in any order to optimize efficiency, but must adhere to each turbine's operational downtime windows.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously in any order, distance limits (L) due to the nautical mile radius constraint, and time windows (TW) for turbine maintenance. There is no indication of open routes (O), as vessels must return to the depot (safe return before fuel depletion). Thus, VRPMBLTW is the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 8
Description: A catering firm must deliver food supplies and equipment to venues (<loc_customer>) hosting events with strict start times (<time_windows>). After events conclude, trucks collect reusable items like tables/chairs. Vehicles departing from the kitchen (<loc_depot>) have limited cargo space (<capacity>). The challenge is sequencing deliveries and pickups across multiple locations without exceeding capacity, ensuring all venues are stocked before their events begin and equipment is retrieved promptly post-event.
Reason: The problem involves both deliveries and pickups with time windows. Each venue requires delivery before the event starts (time window) and pickup after the event (another time window), allowing mixed sequencing of deliveries and pickups as long as per-venue precedence is maintained. This aligns with 'MB' (mixed backhaul) and 'TW' (time windows). Capacity constraints are present but secondary to these features. Vehicles depart from a depot but there's no mention of open routes, so 'O' is excluded. The most specific variant is VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 94
Description: For a major sports event, logistics teams deliver sports equipment, temporary seating, and infrastructure to venues across the host city. After the event concludes, they must retrieve all materials for return or recycling. Vehicles start from a central storage depot (<loc_depot>), carrying mixed cargo: delivering equipment to venues (<loc_customer>) and later collecting dismantled items. Each vehicle’s capacity (<capacity>) must not be exceeded, and routes must adhere to a maximum distance limit (<distance_limit>). The goal is to design open routes ending at the final venue, avoiding unnecessary return trips, while efficiently managing both outbound and inbound cargo.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at the final venue without returning to the depot, backhaul (B) since deliveries (linehaul) must be completed before collections (backhaul) occur, and distance limits (L). The 'later collecting' indicates sequential handling of linehaul and backhaul, not mixed, aligning with standard backhaul (B) rather than mixed backhaul (MB). Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 65
Description: A company must deliver sound systems, stages, and lighting equipment to multiple outdoor concert venues (linehaul) and later collect all items after the events (backhaul). Each venue has strict time windows for setup and teardown based on performance schedules. Trucks must ensure equipment capacity limits are not exceeded while coordinating with event timelines to avoid delays or overtime costs.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (delivering and later collecting equipment) and time window constraints at venues, which are critical for setup and teardown. The description specifies that backhaul occurs after linehaul (strict order) and requires coordination with event timelines (time windows). There is no mention of open routes (O), mixed backhaul (MB), or distance limits (L), so the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 83
Description: A space agency’s logistics team delivers precision components to rocket launch sites (linehaul) and retrieves scrap metal from disassembled satellite equipment (backhaul). Launch site deliveries must align with narrow time windows (e.g., 12:00–12:30 PM) to avoid interfering with countdown procedures, while scrap pickups occur after decommissioning. Vehicles must handle the weight of delicate components and dense scrap metal within a <capacity> kg limit. Routes conclude at the final launchpad or scrap collection point, avoiding depot returns.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles do not return to the depot), backhaul demands (scrap pickups after linehaul deliveries), and time window constraints for linehaul deliveries. While capacity is mentioned, it is superseded by the presence of O, B, and TW. The problem does not explicitly require mixed backhaul (MB) or distance limits (L).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 86
Description: In the aftermath of a storm, relief teams must deliver emergency supplies to affected areas (<loc_customer>) and collect hazardous debris for disposal. Trucks (<capacity>) departing from a central hub (<loc_depot>) must adhere to strict time windows (<time_windows>) for site access (e.g., during daylight hours). Routes must not exceed a daily travel limit (<distance_limit>) to conserve fuel. Vehicles end their routes at temporary waste collection centers, avoiding return trips to the depot.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at collection centers, backhaul (B) with both delivery and collection, distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). The combination of these features corresponds to the 'OVRPBLTW' variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 28
Description: Farmers require seed deliveries before planting season and later need their harvested crops collected for storage. Each farm has time windows aligned with seasonal planting/harvesting schedules. Trucks must carry seeds to farms (deliveries) and later transport crops back to the depot (pickups), adhering to capacity limits for perishable or heavy loads. Routes must remain within distance constraints to ensure timely service without overextending drivers or delaying post-harvest processing.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as crops must be collected after seeds are delivered, time windows (TW) for each farm, and distance constraints (L) on routes. The combination of B, L, and TW makes VRPBLTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 13
Description: A winery delivers wine bottles (linehaul) to retail stores (<loc_customer>) and collects grape pomace (backhaul) from vineyards for composting. Trucks with a <capacity> kg limit must first complete all deliveries to ensure freshness, then proceed to vineyards for waste pickup. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius of the central warehouse (<loc_depot>) to maintain refrigeration for perishable items and reduce emissions. The winery aims to optimize fuel costs and logistical efficiency while adhering to strict capacity and distance restrictions.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) where trucks must complete linehaul deliveries before backhaul pickups, and a distance limit (L) constraint. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O), making VRPBL the most specific variant that combines backhaul and distance restrictions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 66
Description: A film production company requires trucks to transport camera gear, props, and set pieces to remote filming locations (linehaul) and later retrieve the equipment after scenes are shot (backhaul). Each location has time windows tied to filming schedules, and trucks must balance payloads of heavy equipment without exceeding capacity, while adhering to tight production timelines.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands (B) with time window constraints (TW) at each location. The description specifies that equipment must be transported to locations (linehaul) and later retrieved (backhaul), with time windows tied to filming schedules. There is no mention of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhaul (MB), so the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 68
Description: A healthcare logistics firm redistributes MRI and CT scanners (linehaul) to hospitals while collecting biohazard-contaminated waste (backhaul) from imaging labs. Hospitals demand equipment within specific operational hours to avoid downtime, and waste must be retrieved within 4 hours of generation. Vehicles are restricted to a 250km route to ensure waste freshness and have dual capacity limits for medical gear and hazardous materials. Routes terminate at the last hospital without depot return.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles terminate at the last hospital without returning to the depot. It includes mixed backhaul (MB) since vehicles handle both linehaul (delivering equipment) and backhaul (waste collection) simultaneously, supported by dual capacity limits. Time windows (TW) are present for hospital deliveries and waste retrieval (4-hour constraint). Distance limits (L) of 250km are enforced. Thus, the combination of O, MB, L, and TW makes 'OVRPMBLTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 73
Description: A security provider deploys equipment (linehaul) to event venues before setup deadlines (TW) and retrieves gear (backhaul) after the event concludes (TW). Vehicles (C) must carry bulky equipment efficiently. Routes are constrained by distance limits (L) to ensure rapid deployment. Drivers start at the depot, deliver gear, then collect it afterward, ending at the depot for storage—avoiding extra trips to optimize resource use.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as equipment must be retrieved after delivery, distance limits (L) to constrain route lengths, and time windows (TW) for both deployment and retrieval. The requirement for drivers to start and end at the depot rules out 'O' (open route), and the strict separation of linehaul and backhaul phases (no simultaneous handling) excludes 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 17
Description: A healthcare provider sends vans to deliver medical equipment and vaccines (linehaul) to remote clinics and collects blood samples or diagnostic specimens (backhaul) for laboratory analysis. Each van has a limited capacity to accommodate both supplies and perishable biological materials. Deliveries must arrive before clinics’ operational hours end (time windows), and pickups follow to ensure samples are retrieved promptly. Routes are restricted by distance limits to avoid delays in rural areas with poor infrastructure. The objective is to balance load constraints, time windows, and route feasibility to maximize service efficiency.
Reason: The problem involves Backhaul (B) as it requires collecting specimens after deliveries, Distance Limits (L) due to rural infrastructure constraints, and Time Windows (TW) for clinic operations and sample retrieval. These features collectively define the VRPBLTW variant, which explicitly includes all three constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 63
Description: In flood-stricken regions, relief trucks (<capacity> capacity) distribute bottled water (linehaul) to evacuation centers (<loc_customer>) and collect contaminated waste (backhaul). Each center has time windows (<time_windows>) for receiving supplies and waste pickup to align with emergency crew schedules. Routes originate from a logistics hub (<loc_depot>), ending at the last serviced location to prioritize rapid response over vehicle return.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at the last serviced location, backhaul demands (B) for contaminated waste collection after linehaul delivery, and time window constraints (TW) at evacuation centers. These features align with the 'OVRPBTW' variant, which combines open routes, backhaul, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 76
Description: An aviation maintenance provider supplies replacement parts to airports for aircraft repairs (linehaul) and collects defective components (backhaul) for analysis. Trucks start from a central depot and conclude routes at the final airport, avoiding return journeys. Each vehicle’s capacity (C) must accommodate both new parts and returned items. Distance limits (L) ensure operational efficiency in remote regions, preventing fuel shortages or extended delays.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles do not return to the depot, hence "O"), backhaul demands (collection of defective components, which can be satisfied alongside linehaul delivery as capacity must accommodate both simultaneously, indicating mixed backhaul "MB"), and distance limits ("L"). There is no mention of time windows, so "TW" is excluded. The combination of these features corresponds to the OVRPMBL variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 1
Description: A sustainable farming cooperative delivers fresh produce (<demand_linehaul>) to grocery stores and restaurants (<loc_customer>) while collecting organic waste (e.g., compostable packaging) from those same locations (<demand_backhaul>). Trucks start at the distribution hub (<loc_depot>) and can sequence deliveries and pickups freely to optimize routing. The <capacity> ton capacity of each vehicle must accommodate both outgoing produce and incoming compost. Drivers finish their routes at the last stop, reducing unnecessary backtracking. The challenge is to maximize efficiency while adhering to weight limits and ensuring timely service for perishable goods.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as drivers finish at the last stop, mixed backhauls (MB) since linehaul and backhaul can be sequenced freely, and time window constraints (TW) to ensure timely service for perishables. Capacity is present but secondary to these features. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 67
Description: Scientists conducting fieldwork in remote wilderness areas need equipment (e.g., lab kits, camping gear) delivered to research sites and biological/environmental samples (soil, water, flora/fauna) picked up for analysis. Vehicles must manage mixed payloads without overloading, as some samples require refrigeration while others occupy space. Each route must stay within a maximum distance to ensure researchers can return to base before fuel exhaustion, critical in areas with no refueling infrastructure.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul demands (delivering equipment and picking up samples) and distance limits (routes must stay within maximum distance to return to base). Since the vehicles need to return to the depot, the route is closed (no "O"). There is no mention of time windows or mixed backhaul order, so "B" (backhaul) and "L" (distance limits) are the applicable constraints, making VRPBL the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 31
Description: A winery distributes wine bottles to distributors (linehaul) and collects grape waste from vineyards (backhaul). Deliveries to retailers must occur before regional wine festivals (time windows), while grape collection aligns with harvest schedules. Trucks must balance the weight of glass bottles (linehaul) and organic waste (backhaul) without exceeding <capacity> tons. A route might involve dropping off bottles to a downtown store (by noon) then immediately collecting pruned vines from a vineyard (before sunset) to meet composting deadlines.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (B) and time window (TW) constraints. Backhaul (grape waste collection) occurs after linehaul (wine delivery), aligning with standard backhaul definition. Time windows are specified for deliveries (before festivals/noon) and collections (harvest schedules/sunset). There's no mention of mixed backhaul (MB) allowing simultaneous linehaul and backhaul, open routes (O), or distance limits (L), making VRPBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 31
Description: A rental company supplies temporary equipment (stages, lighting rigs, audio systems) to venues for live events. Trucks depart from a warehouse (<loc_depot>) and must deliver gear to event sites (<demand_linehaul>) before setup deadlines (<time_windows>). After events conclude, the same vehicles collect used equipment (<demand_backhaul>) within post-event pickup windows. Capacity constraints (<capacity>) require balancing heavy deliveries and bulky returns. Routes are planned to maximize efficiency, allowing drivers to end their shifts at the last pickup location without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles do not return to the depot: 'O'), backhaul demand (equipment collection after deliveries: 'B'), and time windows for both deliveries and pickups ('TW'). While capacity constraints exist, they are secondary to 'O', 'B', and 'TW'. Since backhaul is only addressed after linehaul (events conclude before pickups), it is standard backhaul ('B'), not mixed ('MB'). There is no mention of distance limits ('L'). Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 69
Description: A university’s logistics team must deliver exam papers, proctor kits, and security equipment to campuses (linehaul) and later collect all materials, including completed exams (backhaul). Each campus has strict time windows aligned with exam schedules, and trucks must ensure capacity limits for sensitive materials while adhering to strict deadlines to prevent delays in academic processes.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands (B) with strict time windows (TW) at each campus. The backhaul (collection) must occur after delivering exam materials, aligning with the backhaul definition. Time windows are explicitly mentioned, necessitating TW. Capacity constraints are present but are secondary to B and TW as per the problem's priority rules. There is no mention of distance limits (L) or open routes (O), so those are excluded.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 7
Description: An electronics retailer operates a “trade-in” program where customers receive new devices (linehaul) and return old electronics (backhaul). Trucks depart from the warehouse at <loc_depot> to <num_customer> locations (<loc_customer>), each with a specified new-product demand (<demand_linehaul>) and e-waste pickup volume (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles must adhere to a <capacity> kg weight limit and cannot travel more than <distance_limit> km per route to avoid overnight storage. The retailer prioritizes minimizing total distance while allowing flexible stop sequences.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands at the same customer locations, indicating mixed backhaul ('MB'). The vehicles have a distance limit ('L'), and the absence of a requirement to return to the depot implies an open route ('O'). There are no time window constraints mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBL, combining open routes, mixed backhaul, and distance limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 65
Description: A company must deliver new turbine components to offshore wind farms (linehaul) while collecting outdated equipment for recycling (backhaul). The transport vessels have a maximum capacity of <capacity> tons, requiring careful load balancing. Routes must ensure vessels return to the coastal depot within a <distance_limit> nautical mile limit to avoid refueling en route. The goal is to minimize total travel distance while safely handling both deliveries and pickups, adhering to strict environmental regulations.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands that can be handled simultaneously (mixed backhaul, "MB"), a distance limit ("L") for routes, and capacity constraints. Since "MB" and "L" are explicitly mentioned, and "C" is ignored when other features are present, the most specific variant is VRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 96
Description: A maritime logistics company supplies safety equipment and emergency kits to offshore oil platforms and retrieves hazardous waste fluids for disposal. Vehicles must first deliver linehaul items (safety gear) before collecting backhaul waste. Each vessel has a limited capacity, and routes are constrained by a maximum distance to avoid extended fuel shortages. The challenge is to design paths that reach all platforms efficiently while adhering to both capacity and distance limits.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) that must be collected only after delivering linehaul items, as well as distance limits (L) on routes to prevent fuel shortages. There is no mention of open routes (O) or time windows (TW), and capacity (C) is present but secondary to the backhaul and distance constraints. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBL.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 95
Description: A telecommunications provider must rapidly deploy temporary cell towers to disaster-affected regions to restore connectivity. Each site has a critical time window for installation to meet urgent demands. After the crisis, towers must be retrieved and returned to the depot. Vehicles must first deliver equipment (linehaul) within setup time windows, then later collect the towers (backhaul), ensuring deliveries precede pickups. Route planning must respect vehicle capacities and strict timelines to avoid overloading while minimizing travel distance.
Reason: The problem involves time window constraints (TW) for installation and vehicle capacities, as well as backhaul demands (B) where deliveries must precede pickups. The description explicitly mentions time windows for installation and the need to respect vehicle capacities. Additionally, the requirement to deliver first and then collect later indicates backhaul with linehaul preceding backhaul. There is no mention of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhaul (MB), making VRPBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 96
Description: A rail operator expands services temporarily and needs to install ticketing kiosks and boarding gates at stations. Each station has a setup time window to avoid disrupting regular operations. After the expansion, equipment must be retrieved. Vehicles must deliver gear (linehaul) to stations within their time windows, then return later to collect items (backhaul), ensuring deliveries come first. Routes must balance capacity limits and time constraints to maintain service schedules.
Reason: The problem involves both time window constraints (TW) at each station and backhaul demands (B) where equipment must be delivered (linehaul) before being retrieved (backhaul). There is no mention of distance limits (L) or mixed backhaul (MB), and routes are not explicitly required to return to the depot (O). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW, combining backhaul and time window constraints.

Description: An oil drilling company must supply remote offshore platforms with equipment and personnel while removing toxic waste for safe disposal. Helicopters and supply boats (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a coastal terminal (<loc_depot>), serving <num_customer> rigs (<loc_customer>). Each rig’s schedule includes strict crew shift windows (<time_windows>) for deliveries and pickup times for waste containers. Vehicles must complete their missions within a <distance_limit> nautical mile limit to ensure return before adverse weather. Crews can interleave supply drops and waste collection in any sequence, but must account for fluctuating rig accessibility due to tides and drilling operations.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as supply drops and waste collection can be interleaved, distance limits (L) due to the nautical mile constraint, and time windows (TW) for rig service. Vehicles must return to the depot (no 'O'), so the variant is VRPMBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 77
Description: A sports league operator delivers sports equipment to stadiums before games and collects it post-event. Each venue has strict time windows for setup and teardown. Delivery trucks must first distribute gear (linehaul) to all locations, then return to collect the equipment (backhaul). Capacity constraints limit the number of items per truck, and routes are restricted to a maximum distance to cover multiple venues efficiently. All deliveries must precede game starts, and pickups must align with post-game cleanup schedules.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as equipment must be collected after delivery, distance limits (L) on routes, and strict time windows (TW) for both delivery and pickup. These three constraints (B, L, TW) are present, making VRPBLTW the most specific variant. Capacity (C) is mentioned but superseded by other constraints.

Description: A pharmaceutical company delivers time-sensitive medications to pharmacies and nursing homes, while simultaneously retrieving empty pill bottles for recycling. Each vehicle carries a <capacity> kg payload, balancing delivery demands (<demand_linehaul>) and pickup quotas (<demand_backhaul>). Pharmacies have strict <time_window> windows for receiving perishable drugs, while bottle pickups must occur after the facility’s closing hours. Drivers must complete all deliveries before initiating pickups, ensuring compliance with health regulations and avoiding overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem requires vehicles to handle both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) with a strict order of completing all deliveries before pickups (B). Pharmacies have strict time windows (TW) for deliveries, and pickups must occur after closing hours, which also implies time window constraints. There is no mention of open routes (O) or distance limits (L). Mixed backhaul (MB) is not applicable since pickups cannot be done simultaneously with deliveries. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: CVRP, Predicted: VRPTW, Index: 43
Description: A sports organization is preparing for a multi-venue championship and must deliver equipment (scoreboards, goals, etc.) to <num_customer> stadiums. Each venue has a specific equipment requirement (<demand> kg). Delivery trucks from <loc_depot> have a <capacity> kg capacity. The challenge is to plan routes that cover all venues without overloading any truck, minimizing total travel distance to stay within budget and ensure equipment arrives before events start.
Reason: The problem specifies minimizing travel distance to ensure equipment arrives before events start, implying time window constraints for delivery. Each venue must be served before its event starts, which corresponds to TW (time window) constraints. There is no mention of backhaul, distance limits, or open routes, so the most specific variant is VRPTW.

Description: A cultural organization deploys temporary public art installations (sculptures, murals) across urban areas and later retrieves them for reuse. Trucks start at an art depot, delivering artworks to city locations while picking up expired exhibits from earlier installations. Capacity limits enforce balance between outgoing and incoming loads, and routes must not exceed distance thresholds to ensure timely deployment and retrieval within a single shift. Stop order is flexible to minimize detours.
Reason: The problem involves Mixed Backhaul (MB) as trucks both deliver and collect artworks simultaneously without order constraints, distance Limits (L) due to route thresholds, and Capacity (C) which is considered but secondary to MB and L. No Open route (O) is indicated as vehicles likely return to the depot, and no Time Windows (TW) are explicitly mentioned.

Description: A retail chain operates temporary pop-up stores in urban areas. Logistics teams must deliver store fixtures, inventory, and signage while collecting empty containers and dismantled equipment after events. Locations have time windows for setup (to avoid traffic disruptions) and teardown (to comply with municipal permits), requiring precise coordination between deliveries and pickups.
Reason: The problem involves both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) with time window constraints for setup and teardown. The backhaul (collection of empty containers and dismantled equipment) occurs after the deliveries (setup phase), aligning with the 'B' (backhaul) definition. Additionally, the requirement for precise coordination due to time windows for setup and teardown necessitates 'TW'. There is no mention of open routes ('O'), distance limits ('L'), or mixed backhaul ('MB'), making 'VRPBTW' the most specific variant.

Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: VRPTW, Index: 42
Description: A hospital chain operates on strict shift schedules, requiring fresh linen deliveries (C) to wards by the start of morning, afternoon, and night shifts (TW). Linen trucks must complete all deliveries within an 8-hour window (L) to comply with driver shift limits and avoid disrupting patient care. Routes must balance load capacities, time windows for ward access, and the need to return to the central laundry facility daily.
Reason: The problem specifies time windows (TW) for deliveries by the start of each shift (morning, afternoon, night) at the wards, which directly corresponds to the TW constraint. While an 8-hour window (L) is mentioned for truck operations, the user-provided definitions associate L with distance limits, not time. The primary constraint is the per-ward time windows (TW). Capacity (C) is mentioned but superseded by TW. There is no indication of backhaul (B) or open routes (O). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 9
Description: A farming cooperative sends tractors, harvesters, and irrigation systems to farms (<loc_customer>) and retrieves them after use. Trucks must carry both equipment deliveries and returned machinery, adhering to capacity limits (<capacity>). Routes are constrained by distance (<distance_limit> km) due to remote farm locations, with vehicles terminating at their final destination. The goal is to streamline equipment circulation while minimizing travel costs and respecting load limits.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles terminate at their final destination, <O>), backhaul demands (retrieving returned machinery after delivering equipment, <B>), and distance constraints (<L>). Capacity constraints are present but secondary to these features. The combination of O, B, and L aligns with the OVRPBL variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 95
Description: A space agency must resupply a lunar outpost with scientific equipment, life-support materials, and emergency supplies. Rockets departing from Earth’s launchpad (<loc_depot>) have a maximum payload capacity (<capacity> kg). Each delivery must align with narrow orbital launch windows (<time_windows>) to minimize travel time and energy consumption. Rockets also face a strict distance limit (<distance_limit>) due to fuel constraints, requiring precise trajectory planning to reach the moon and return to transfer points. The challenge is to schedule launches and allocate cargo optimally while ensuring all supplies reach the outpost within operational timelines and capacity limits.
Reason: The problem involves rockets that must return to transfer points (Open route 'O'), have a strict distance limit due to fuel constraints ('L'), and must align with narrow orbital launch windows ('TW'). Capacity is mentioned but superseded by the presence of 'O', 'L', and 'TW'. There is no indication of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 84
Description: A healthcare provider distributes temperature-sensitive vaccines to rural clinics (linehaul) while collecting expired medical supplies and sharps (backhaul). Refrigerated trucks have strict capacity limits for both vaccines and waste. Routes begin at a central hub but end at the last clinic to minimize turnaround time. Time windows align with vaccine storage requirements and clinic operating hours. Distance limits ensure vaccines remain within safe temperature ranges during transport, while pickup times for medical waste comply with hazardous material regulations.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at the last clinic, backhaul (B) for collecting waste after linehaul deliveries, distance limits (L) to ensure safe vaccine transport, and time windows (TW) for clinics and hazardous waste pickup. These features correspond to the 'OVRPBLTW' variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 86
Description: A university needs to distribute sealed exam kits to multiple campuses and later collect them after examinations. Each campus has a strict time window (TW) for receiving exams (linehaul) and returning completed kits (backhaul). Delivery trucks (capacity <capacity>) must navigate mixed routes, ensuring no vehicle overloads while adhering to strict academic timelines. Routes conclude at the final pickup point (O), avoiding return trips to the central office. The challenge is to synchronize deliveries and collections to prevent exam leaks or delays.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles conclude at the final pickup point, backhaul (B) for collecting exams after deliveries, and strict time windows (TW) for both linehaul and backhaul operations. There is no mention of distance limits (L) or mixed backhaul (MB), as backhauls are only performed after deliveries (implied by "later collect them after examinations"). Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 99
Description: A semiconductor factory requires precise deliveries of chemicals and substrates (linehaul) to production bays within strict time windows to maintain schedules. Post-processing, hazardous waste must be collected (backhaul) and returned to the depot. Vehicles must ensure deliveries occur before pickups, stay within capacity limits, and adhere to time windows to prevent production delays. Routes end at the depot after waste retrieval, optimizing efficiency without mandatory returns.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as hazardous waste must be collected after linehaul deliveries are completed, time windows (TW) for deliveries, and routes end at the depot (no 'O' for open routes). Vehicles must adhere to capacity limits and sequence deliveries before pickups, fitting the VRPBTW variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 69
Description: A security firm deploys barriers, cameras, and monitoring systems to venues hosting high-profile events. Trucks (<capacity> kg) must deliver equipment ahead of event start times (<time_window>), then retrieve gear immediately after the event concludes. Delivery routes prioritize venues with earlier start times, while pickups follow strict post-event schedules to avoid congestion. The <service_time> includes setup and takedown coordination with event staff, ensuring all equipment is secured before departing for the final stop.
Reason: The problem involves both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) phases with the requirement that deliveries must be prioritized before pickups (B), and time windows are explicitly specified for both delivery (prioritizing earlier event start times) and pickup (strict post-event schedules to avoid congestion) (TW). There is no indication of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhauls (MB).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 87
Description: Following a major earthquake, construction crews must deliver reinforced steel beams and concrete additives to damaged urban areas. Each site (<loc_customer>) has a time window (<time_windows>) for material arrival to align with reconstruction schedules. Heavy-duty trucks (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a regional depot (<loc_depot>), but mountainous terrain limits their travel range (<distance_limit> km). Routes must prioritize timely delivery while avoiding overloading and ensuring no truck exceeds its maximum journey distance.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>) for deliveries and distance limits (<distance_limit>) for trucks, which correspond to the TW (time window) and L (distance limit) attributes. There is no explicit mention of open routes (O) or backhaul (B/MB) constraints. Thus, the most specific variant combining L and TW is VRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 84
Description: A polar research organization must deliver supplies (<demand>) to isolated Arctic stations (<loc_customer>) during narrow seasonal ice-free windows (<time_windows>). Cargo planes (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a base (<loc_depot>), but must return before fuel depletion (<distance_limit> km). Critical supplies like food and equipment must be delivered before winter sets in, requiring precise timing to avoid trapping crews in extreme conditions.
Reason: The problem specifies that cargo planes must return to the depot before fuel depletion, indicating a distance limit ('L'). Additionally, deliveries must occur during narrow seasonal ice-free windows, which are time window constraints ('TW'). There is no mention of backhaul ('B') or open routes ('O'), and capacity is mentioned but is superseded by the presence of 'L' and 'TW'. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 83
Description: A healthcare startup uses drones to transport temperature-sensitive medical samples (<demand>) from hospitals (<loc_customer>) to a central lab (<loc_depot>). Each drone has a limited payload (<capacity> kg) and battery range (<distance_limit> km). Samples must arrive at the lab within strict time windows (<time_windows>) to ensure diagnostic accuracy. Routes must optimize flight paths to avoid delays while respecting energy constraints.
Reason: The problem includes both distance limits (L) due to battery range constraints and time windows (TW) for sample arrival at the lab. There is no mention of backhaul (B) requirements or open routes (O) where drones do not return to the depot. Since the problem specifies both L and TW, the most specific variant is VRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 66
Description: A film production company requires trucks to transport camera gear, lighting rigs, and props to multiple shooting locations. After filming concludes, the same vehicles collect all equipment and discarded set materials (e.g., unused props, temporary structures). Routes must balance delivery and pickup tasks without overloading trucks, ending at the last site visited to optimize fuel and labor costs.
Reason: The problem requires open routes (ending at the last site, not returning to the depot, indicating 'O') and involves backhaul demands (collecting equipment after delivery tasks are completed, aligning with 'B'). While capacity constraints are mentioned, they are secondary to the 'O' and 'B' features. There is no indication of mixed backhaul ('MB'), time windows ('TW'), or distance limits ('L'). Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPB.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 11
Description: A coastal environmental agency uses research vessels to deploy scientific instruments (linehaul) to <num_customer> marine monitoring stations (<loc_customer>) and later collect plastic waste (backhaul) from polluted beaches. Each vessel has a <capacity> ton capacity for equipment and waste. The equipment deployment phase must occur before waste collection to avoid contamination of scientific gear. Vessels must also adhere to a <distance_limit> nautical mile limit to ensure safe return to the base port (<loc_depot>) without refueling. The challenge is optimizing routes to cover all stations and cleanup sites efficiently while balancing cargo weight and avoiding overreach of travel limits.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands with a strict order (equipment deployment before waste collection), which corresponds to Backhaul (B). Additionally, the vessels have a distance limit (L) to ensure safe return to the depot. There is no mention of open routes (O), time windows (TW), or mixed backhaul (MB). The presence of B and L makes VRPBL the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 76
Description: A utility company deploys new smart meters to residential neighborhoods while collecting outdated meters for recycling. Technicians must first deliver new meters (linehaul) within homeowners’ scheduled time windows, then return to retrieve the old units (backhaul). Each van’s capacity restricts the number of meters it can carry. Routes are capped at a distance limit to ensure timely service, with all installations finalized before the next billing cycle and pickups completed within a week.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW) for linehaul deliveries, backhaul (B) for collecting old meters after all linehaul is done, and distance limits (L) on routes. These features correspond to the VRPBLTW variant, which combines Backhaul, Limited distance, and Time Windows constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 21
Description: A solar energy company deploys technicians to install new solar panels at residential sites (<loc_customer>) and collect decommissioned equipment for recycling. Each truck carries a mix of new panels (<demand_linehaul>) and empty containers for old equipment (<demand_backhaul>), constrained by vehicle capacity (<capacity>). Routes must start at the warehouse (<loc_depot>) but terminate at the final stop without returning, adhering to a strict distance limit (<distance_limit>) to prevent overexertion of drivers in remote areas.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, backhaul demand (B) for collecting decommissioned equipment (served after linehaul deliveries), and a strict distance limit (L). These features align with the OVRPBL variant, which combines open routes, backhaul constraints, and distance limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 25
Description: A university's logistics team must distribute lab equipment, teaching materials, and supplies to scattered academic departments while simultaneously collecting outdated or returned items for recycling or redistribution. Vehicles depart from the central supply depot (<loc_depot>) with a maximum capacity (<capacity>). The mixed backhaul routes allow deliveries (e.g., textbooks to lecture halls) and pickups (e.g., used lab kits from research labs) in any sequence (MB). Each department specifies time windows (<TW>) for service (e.g., avoiding class hours), and routes must not exceed a daily distance limit (<L>) to comply with driver work-hour regulations. The goal is to minimize total travel distance while ensuring all departments are serviced within their constraints.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as deliveries and pickups can occur in any sequence, time windows (TW) specified by departments, and a distance limit (L) for routes. These three features (MB, L, TW) are all present, and there is no mention of open routes (O). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPMBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 12
Description: An aviation maintenance company dispatches trucks to deliver replacement aircraft parts (linehaul) to airports (<loc_customer>) and later collect used or defective components (backhaul) for recycling. Each truck’s <capacity> kg limit must accommodate both outgoing parts and returned materials. Deliveries must precede pickups to ensure planes are serviced promptly. Furthermore, each truck’s route cannot exceed a <distance_limit> km limit to comply with flight crew schedules and avoid overnight travel. The depot (<loc_depot>) coordinates routes to minimize total distance while ensuring all parts are delivered and retrieved without violating constraints.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) where deliveries must precede pickups, distance limits (L) for each truck's route, and there is no explicit mention of vehicles returning to the depot. However, since the depot coordinates routes to minimize total distance and the problem does not explicitly state that vehicles do not return, the default assumption is closed routes. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBL (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and distance Limits).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 50
Description: A solar energy company must deliver newly manufactured solar panels to remote rural communities (linehaul) and simultaneously collect used lithium-ion batteries from previous installations (backhaul). Each truck has a capacity of <capacity> kg, requiring careful balancing between the weight of panels and the volume of returned batteries. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius to ensure vehicles can return to the depot before depleting fuel, especially in rugged terrain. The goal is to optimize delivery efficiency while adhering to environmental regulations for battery disposal.
Reason: The problem involves simultaneous linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (collections) of goods, indicating mixed backhaul (MB). Additionally, the distance limit (L) constraint is explicitly stated to ensure trucks return to the depot. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O), and the capacity constraint (C) is secondary to MB and L. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 79
Description: A maritime logistics team supplies maintenance parts to offshore wind turbines while retrieving scrap metal for recycling. Supply vessels (<capacity> ton capacity) must navigate tidal and weather constraints (<time_windows>), ensuring arrivals during safe access periods. After servicing turbines, crews collect scrap from platforms (<demand_backhaul>). Routes start from a coastal depot (<loc_depot>) but conclude at the final offshore site, avoiding unnecessary return trips. The goal is to maximize efficiency while respecting environmental regulations and capacity limits.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles do not return to the depot, indicated by 'O'), backhaul demand (collecting scrap after servicing turbines, 'B'), and time window constraints (tidal/weather safety periods, 'TW'). There is no mention of distance limits ('L') or mixed backhaul ('MB'). Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 26
Description: A festival organizer must deploy equipment (stages, generators, sound systems) to multiple sites (linehaul) before event start times and retrieve it afterward (backhaul), while also collecting waste materials during teardown. Each venue has strict setup and teardown deadlines (TW), and trucks (<capacity> tons) must prioritize delivery/pickup sequences to maximize efficiency. For example, a stage truck might first drop off equipment at a daytime venue (linehaul), then backtrack to collect trash from a night event (backhaul) without overloading.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands with strict time window (TW) constraints for setup and teardown, and prioritization of linehaul before backhaul (B). Capacity is mentioned but superseded by B and TW. There is no indication of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhaul (MB). Thus, the most specific variant is VRP with Backhaul and Time Windows (VRPBTW).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 12
Description: An agricultural cooperative supplies farmers with seeds and fertilizers while collecting harvested crops (e.g., wheat, corn) for processing. Trucks must carry both outgoing supplies (linehaul) and incoming agricultural products (backhaul), constrained by a maximum capacity. The distance limit ensures vehicles can reach remote farms and return to the depot before sunset, avoiding overnight storage. The objective is to optimize routes to maximize delivery efficiency, reduce transportation costs, and ensure crops are collected promptly to maintain freshness and quality.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering supplies) and backhaul (collecting crops) demands, which must be satisfied with trucks constrained by a maximum capacity and a distance limit to ensure return to the depot before sunset. The distance limit corresponds to the "L" attribute, and the backhaul requirement corresponds to the "B" attribute. There is no mention of time windows ("TW") or open routes ("O"), and backhauls are likely required to be handled after linehauls (standard backhaul, not mixed). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 65
Description: A biotech company operates a program to replace outdated lab equipment with cutting-edge models. Their logistics team must deliver new equipment (linehaul) to research facilities while collecting the obsolete devices (backhaul) for recycling. Each lab has a strict operational window for equipment swaps to avoid disrupting experiments, with service times requiring precise coordination. Vehicles are limited to a 200km route distance to ensure rapid deployment, and their capacity must accommodate both new gear and bulky old equipment. Routes conclude at the final lab without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at the final lab, mixed backhaul (MB) since labs require simultaneous delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul), distance limits (L) of 200km, and time window (TW) constraints for lab service. These features align with the 'OVRPMBLTW' variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 5
Description: A construction company needs to supply materials like steel beams and cement to active building sites (<loc_customer>) while also collecting recyclable waste (e.g., scrap metal) from those same sites. Trucks depart from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>) with a maximum capacity (<capacity> tons) and must manage both deliveries and pickups in any sequence. Each site has strict access windows (<time_windows>) enforced by city regulations, requiring trucks to arrive precisely when work is ongoing. The goal is to minimize total mileage while ensuring no truck exceeds its weight limit and all materials are delivered/picked up within operational hours.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as both deliveries and pickups can be handled in any sequence, time windows (TW) due to strict site access constraints, and capacity limits (C). Since MB and TW are present, "C" is not explicitly included in the variant name. The depot is a central warehouse, implying closed routes (no "O"). No distance limits (L) are mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 4
Description: During a crisis, relief organizations distribute food and medical supplies (<demand_linehaul>) to disaster zones while collecting feedback forms and medical samples (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles from the emergency hub (<loc_depot>) must not exceed <capacity> kg and respect time windows (<time_windows>) to prioritize urgent needs. Routes are capped at <distance_limit> km to conserve fuel and ensure driver safety. Teams finalize their routes at the most remote aid stations, avoiding return journeys to the depot.
Reason: The problem description includes open routes (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, backhaul demand (B) for collecting feedback/medical samples after distributing supplies, distance limits (L) on routes, and time window constraints (TW). These correspond to the 'OVRPBLTW' variant, which encapsulates all mentioned features.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 16
Description: A research supply company delivers specialized lab equipment to remote research facilities and collects hazardous biological or chemical samples for analysis. Each van (capacity <capacity>) departs from the central lab (<loc_depot>), first delivering equipment to remote sites, then collecting samples from those same locations. The backhaul phase must occur only after all deliveries are finalized to avoid contamination or equipment damage. The goal is to minimize travel distance while ensuring sample integrity and adherence to safety protocols.
Reason: The problem specifies that backhaul (sample collection) must occur only after all deliveries are completed, which aligns with the VRPB variant where backhaul demands are satisfied after linehaul demands. No mention of time windows (TW), distance limits (L), or open routes (O) implies these are not critical here. Capacity is mentioned but secondary to the backhaul constraint.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 72
Description: A museum consortium transports fragile artifacts (<demand_linehaul>) to temporary exhibits while retrieving empty storage containers (<demand_backhaul>) from prior exhibitions. Vehicles departing from the central archive (<loc_depot>) must manage weight and space limits (<capacity>), ensuring artifacts are secured alongside returned containers. Each route must stay within a <distance_limit> to comply with artifact preservation protocols. Drivers complete their routes at the final destination, allowing exhibits to open on schedule without depot returns.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, backhaul demands (B) for retrieving empty containers, and distance limits (L) for preservation protocols. There is no explicit mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB). Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 74
Description: An advertising company transports new billboards and signage to outdoor locations (linehaul) while retrieving outdated or damaged materials (backhaul) in the same trips. Vehicles start from a central warehouse but finish at the final drop-off point without returning. Capacity limits require careful coordination between the weight of new installations and the volume of collected materials. The goal is to optimize routes for efficient campaign deployment and material recycling while reducing operational expenses.
Reason: The problem involves an open route (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, and backhaul (B) operations where outdated materials are collected after delivering new billboards (linehaul). While the problem mentions capacity constraints, the presence of O and B supersedes the basic CVRP classification. There is no indication of mixed backhaul (MB), time windows (TW), or distance limits (L). Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPB.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 63
Description: A blood bank must deliver life-saving plasma and platelets to hospitals within strict time windows to ensure viability. Empty blood storage containers must be collected afterward for restocking. Refrigerated trucks (capacity: <capacity> liters) must balance perishable deliveries and backhaul pickups, with each route limited to <distance_limit> km to prevent temperature deviations. The challenge is synchronizing time-critical deliveries with efficient container returns to avoid shortages or waste.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW) for deliveries, backhaul (B) for container collection, and distance limits (L) on routes. The mention of strict time windows and 'afterward' collection of containers indicates sequential handling of linehaul and backhaul, fitting the 'B' constraint. The distance constraint (L) and time windows (TW) are explicitly stated. There's no indication of open routes (O) or mixed backhaul (MB), as backhaul occurs after deliveries. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 97
Description: A rescue team deploys emergency kits, medical supplies, and climbing gear to remote mountain shelters (linehaul) and later retrieves used equipment for maintenance. The vehicles must deliver critical supplies first, then collect returned gear. Each vehicle has a capacity limit, and routes must stay within a distance threshold to ensure rescuers can return safely without refueling. The goal is to service all shelters while minimizing total travel distance and respecting operational constraints.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as vehicles must deliver supplies first and then collect returned gear. Additionally, vehicles are subject to distance limits (L) to ensure safe return without refueling. There is no mention of open routes (O), time windows (TW), or mixed backhaul (MB), making VRPBL the most specific variant that combines backhaul and distance constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 75
Description: Maritime logistics firms must deliver heavy-duty cranes to container ships at designated berths (linehaul) while retrieving scrap metal cargo from returning vessels (backhaul). Each port berth has strict time windows (<time_windows>) aligned with tide schedules and vessel docking periods. Cranes and scrap have varying weights (<demand_linehaul>/<demand_backhaul>), requiring careful load balancing within truck capacities (<capacity>). Once a truck completes its final task—whether dropping a crane or collecting scrap—it remains parked at the terminal to await further assignments, adhering to open-route requirements.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as trucks do not return to the depot after their final task, mixed backhauls (MB) since both linehaul (crane delivery) and backhaul (scrap collection) can be handled in the same route with load balancing, and time windows (TW) at port berths. Capacity constraints are present but are secondary to these features. The combination of O, MB, and TW makes OVRPMBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 99
Description: A university logistics team delivers scientific equipment, lab supplies, and chemicals to research facilities (linehaul) and collects expired or hazardous materials for disposal. Vehicles must first deliver items before retrieving waste. Each vehicle has a strict capacity limit, and routes must not exceed a predefined distance to avoid lengthy return trips. The goal is to plan routes that efficiently service all labs while adhering to safety and operational constraints.
Reason: The problem requires vehicles to deliver items (linehaul) before collecting waste (backhaul), indicating backhaul constraints (B). Additionally, routes have strict distance limits (L). There is no mention of open routes (O), time windows (TW), or mixed backhauls (MB), making VRPBL the most specific variant.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 97
Description: A city’s seasonal bike-sharing program delivers bikes and gear to parks before peak hours (within strict delivery time windows). Returned equipment is later collected. Vehicles must first deliver rentals (linehaul) to park locations within time slots, then return to retrieve items (backhaul), managing capacity to avoid overloading. Timely service ensures equipment availability for users while optimizing routes for efficiency.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles delivering rentals (linehaul) and later collecting returned equipment (backhaul), which must be done after linehaul. Additionally, there are strict delivery time windows. The presence of both backhaul (B) and time windows (TW) makes VRPBTW the most specific variant. Capacity constraints are mentioned but are secondary to B and TW, and no open routes or distance limits are specified.
