Description: Technicians maintain IoT sensors across a city (<loc_customer>) starting from a service center (<loc_depot>). Vehicles carry limited replacement parts (<capacity>) and must complete routes within battery life constraints (<distance_limit>). Some stops require sensor calibration (time-sensitive procedures with fixed <time_windows>) while others involve part replacements or data collection (flexible timing). Calibration procedures have strict duration requirements (<service_time>). The challenge is to optimize routes that respect all technical constraints while minimizing downtown of critical city infrastructure.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that help identify the most specific variant. First, there is a capacity constraint (<capacity>), which is a basic feature of CVRP. However, the presence of other features overrides this. The vehicles have distance limits (<distance_limit>), indicated by 'L'. Some stops have time-sensitive procedures with fixed time windows (<time_windows>), indicated by 'TW'. Additionally, the problem does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, which suggests an open route ('O'). There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, so 'B' and 'MB' are not considered. Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 32
Description: Research vessels (<capacity>) service a network of marine buoys (<loc_customer>) from a coastal base (<loc_depot>). Some buoys require sensor replacements (<demand_linehaul>) while others need data retrieval (<demand_backhaul>). Vessels can service buoys in any order but face <distance_limit> nautical mile range limits due to fuel constraints. The challenge is to maximize scientific data recovery while minimizing operational costs across the buoy network.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (data retrieval) and linehaul demand (sensor replacements), which can be serviced in any order (mixed backhaul). Additionally, the vessels have distance limits due to fuel constraints. There is no mention of time windows or the requirement for vessels to return to the depot, so 'TW' and 'O' are not applicable. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBL', which accounts for mixed backhaul and distance limits.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 69
Description: A health agency coordinates:  
- Testing site setups (<loc_customer>) with time-sensitive appointments (<time_windows>)  
- Concurrent delivery of antiviral medications (<demand>)  
- Collection of used test kits (MB)  
Medical vans (<capacity>) operate within shift duration limits (L), with teams finishing at final locations (O) for disinfection.  
```  

Each scenario emphasizes:  
- **MB**: Seamless mixing of deliveries/pickups  
- **O**: Vehicles conclude routes at final stops  
- **TW**: Strict time-bound service requirements  
- **L**: Route distance/duration constraints  
- **C**: Vehicle capacity limitations  

The descriptions avoid backhaul sequencing requirements and multi-depot constraints as specified.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhaul (MB), open routes (O), time windows (TW), and vehicle capacity (C). Given the presence of 'MB', 'O', and 'TW', the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBTW', which accounts for open routes, mixed backhaul, and time windows. Vehicle capacity is implied but not the primary distinguishing feature in this context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 94
Description: A retailer hosts temporary pop-up stores in urban centers, needing to deliver merchandise (linehaul) before event opening hours (<time_windows>) and collect unsold items (backhaul) after closing. Each delivery van (capacity <capacity>) must fully stock kiosks first, then retrieve excess inventory during teardown. Routes finish at a regional distribution center, bypassing the main warehouse to accelerate restocking for the next location. The challenge is balancing load limits while ensuring pop-ups open on time and excess goods are recovered efficiently, avoiding costly overstock or understock scenarios.
Reason: The problem description involves backhaul demands (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, time window constraints (TW) for both delivery and collection, and the routes finish at a regional distribution center without returning to the main warehouse, indicating an open route (O). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 79
Description: A veterinary service conducts scheduled pet vaccinations (<demand_linehaul>) at community centers (<loc_customer>) within strict time slots (<time_windows>), while transporting rescue animals (<demand_backhaul>) to shelters. Vehicles (<capacity>) with specialized cages must carefully sequence stops to balance medical supplies and live animal cargo, adhering to welfare regulations and appointment times.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B') where rescue animals are transported to shelters after all linehaul demand (pet vaccinations) is satisfied, time windows ('TW') for the scheduled pet vaccinations, and capacity ('C') constraints for the vehicles with specialized cages. There is no mention of distance limits ('L') or open routes ('O'). The backhaul is not mixed ('MB') as the linehaul must be completed before backhaul can begin. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW' which combines backhaul and time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 40
Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile units to deliver vaccines to clinics (<demand_linehaul>) while simultaneously collecting used testing kits (<demand_backhaul>) for safe disposal. Each vehicle (capacity <capacity>) must visit locations (<locs>) within strict time windows (<time_windows>) due to temperature-sensitive cargo. Clinics have limited operating hours, and testing sites require same-day kit retrieval. Routes must balance delivery/pickup sequencing while respecting vehicle capacity and time-critical health protocols.
Reason: The problem description includes both linehaul (delivering vaccines) and backhaul (collecting used testing kits) demands, which can be satisfied simultaneously (mixed backhaul). It also mentions strict time windows for service due to temperature-sensitive cargo and clinic operating hours. There is no mention of vehicles having to return to the depot, suggesting open routes. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 68
Description: A university logistics provider supplies research labs with new equipment while retrieving expired chemicals and hazardous materials for proper disposal. Vehicles must handle both tasks without violating capacity constraints, ensuring safe and efficient handling of sensitive materials.
Reason: The problem involves both delivering new equipment (linehaul) and retrieving expired chemicals (backhaul), which must be handled without violating capacity constraints. The backhaul demand (retrieval) can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand (delivery) is satisfied, as indicated by the need to handle sensitive materials safely and efficiently. This matches the 'B' (backhaul) feature. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), or open routes ('O'), so the most appropriate variant is 'VRPB'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 85
Description: Marine telecommunications engineers must repair undersea internet cables at dispersed oceanic locations. Each repair site has tidal-based time windows (<time_windows>) during which vessels can dock safely. The maintenance vessels (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a coastal base (<loc_depot>), carrying specialized equipment. They must complete repairs before exhausting their fuel range (<distance_limit> km), as mid-ocean refueling is impossible. The goal is to plan routes that deliver all required gear to each site within their tidal windows, while ensuring no vessel exceeds its load or travel limits.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are time window constraints (<time_windows>) for docking at repair sites, which corresponds to 'TW'. Secondly, the vessels have a distance limit (<distance_limit> km), which corresponds to 'L'. Additionally, the vessels must carry specialized equipment (capacity constraint), but since 'L' and 'TW' are present, 'C' is ignored. There is no mention of backhaul demand or mixed backhaul, so 'B' and 'MB' are not considered. The vessels must return to the coastal base (<loc_depot>), so it is not an open route ('O' is not applicable). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPLTW', which combines distance limits and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 56
Description: A festival organizer needs to deploy stages, generators, and tents (linehaul) to multiple outdoor venues before events. After the events, trucks collect recyclable materials like plastic waste and unused supplies (backhaul). Each venue specifies a setup time window (TW) for equipment delivery and a teardown window for waste pickup. Vehicles must first complete all deliveries before initiating pickups, ensuring their total load (equipment + recyclables) never exceeds capacity (<capacity>). Drivers finish routes at the last recycling collection site.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met, time window constraints (TW) for both setup and teardown, and the vehicles do not return to the depot (O) as drivers finish routes at the last recycling collection site. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 9
Description: An airport ground handler delivers checked luggage to departing flight gates (linehaul) and collects inbound cargo shipments (backhaul) from arriving flights. Each task is time-sensitive: luggage must reach gates before boarding, while cargo pickups align with flight arrival times. Vehicles must complete luggage deliveries before cargo pickups and adhere to strict capacity limits for mixed cargo types. Routes are constrained by airport perimeter distance limits to ensure timely turnaround.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW). Additionally, the vehicles must complete luggage deliveries (linehaul) before cargo pickups (backhaul), which is a characteristic of backhaul demand (B) rather than mixed backhaul (MB). The routes are constrained by airport perimeter distance limits (L), and the tasks are time-sensitive (TW). There is no mention of vehicles returning to the depot, suggesting open routes (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 8
Description: A floral hub (<loc_depot>) supplies fresh bouquets to franchise stores (<loc_customer>) and retrieves wilted inventory for composting. Each store has delivery (<demand_linehaul>) and pickup (<demand_backhaul>) needs. Refrigerated vans (<capacity>) can interleave deliveries and collections. Routes are open-ended, with drivers concluding at their final stop. Optimize for freshness by prioritizing high-demand stores while keeping loads within capacity limits.
Reason: The problem description mentions open-ended routes (O), backhaul demand (B), and capacity constraints (C). However, since the problem involves open routes and backhaul demand, the most specific variant is 'OVRPB' (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls). The capacity constraint is implied but not the primary feature when other features like backhaul and open routes are present.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 18
Description: Organizers manage gourmet food trucks servicing multiple festival venues (<loc_customer>). Trucks restock ingredients from a commissary (<loc_depot>) and collect waste (<demand_backhaul>) while operating within venue-specific time slots (<time_windows>). Each truck has limited storage (<capacity>) and must complete routes in <time_limit> hours to maintain food freshness. Trucks remain at their final venue for overnight parking.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple features that need to be considered: 1) 'Organizers manage gourmet food trucks servicing multiple festival venues' implies that the trucks do not return to the depot after servicing the last venue, which aligns with the 'O' (open route) feature. 2) 'collect waste (<demand_backhaul>)' indicates the presence of backhaul demand, which is of type 'B' (backhaul demand must be satisfied after linehaul demand). 3) 'operating within venue-specific time slots (<time_windows>)' specifies time window constraints ('TW'). 4) 'Each truck has limited storage (<capacity>)' is a capacity constraint, but since other features are present, 'C' is ignored. The combination of 'O', 'B', and 'TW' leads to the selection of 'OVRPBTW' as the most specific variant.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 97
Description: A city’s seasonal bike-sharing program delivers bikes and gear to parks before peak hours (within strict delivery time windows). Returned equipment is later collected. Vehicles must first deliver rentals (linehaul) to park locations within time slots, then return to retrieve items (backhaul), managing capacity to avoid overloading. Timely service ensures equipment availability for users while optimizing routes for efficiency.
Reason: The problem description involves delivering bikes and gear to parks within strict delivery time windows (TW), then returning to retrieve items (backhaul, B). The vehicles must manage capacity to avoid overloading (C), but since 'B' and 'TW' are present, 'C' is ignored. The description does not mention distance limits (L) or open routes (O), and it specifies that backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied (B, not MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 74
Description: An outdoor adventure company delivers tents, sleeping bags, and camping gear to travelers (<loc_customer>) for weekend trips (linehaul) and later retrieves the gear post-adventure (backhaul). Each vehicle must first deliver the rented equipment (<demand_linehaul>) to pickup locations such as airports or campgrounds, then collect used gear (<demand_backhaul>) from return points like trailheads or drop-off zones. Routes must start at the central depot (<loc_depot>), prioritize deliveries before pickups, and conclude at the final return location. The goal is to minimize fuel costs while managing gear weight and space (<capacity>) across all stops.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is satisfied, and there is no mention of time windows (TW), distance limits (L), or open routes (O). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPB.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 46
Description: A circular fashion brand rotates inventory between pop-up stores and a central warehouse, delivering new collections (`<demand_linehaul>`) and retrieving unsold items (`<demand_backhaul>`). Each pop-up (`<loc_customer>`) has a narrow time window (`<time_windows>`) for restocking (e.g., before opening hours). Vehicles (`<capacity>`) must balance delivery/pickup sequencing—e.g., a truck might first deliver to Store A, pick up from Store B, then deliver to Store C—while avoiding overcrowding at high-traffic urban locations during peak hours.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows ('<time_windows>'), backhaul demand ('<demand_backhaul>'), and linehaul demand ('<demand_linehaul>'). The backhaul and linehaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously (e.g., delivering to Store A and picking up from Store B in the same trip), which indicates a mixed backhaul ('MB') scenario. Additionally, the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the central warehouse after completing their routes, suggesting an open route ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBTW', which includes open routes, mixed backhaul, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 95
Description: A telecommunications provider must rapidly deploy temporary cell towers to disaster-affected regions to restore connectivity. Each site has a critical time window for installation to meet urgent demands. After the crisis, towers must be retrieved and returned to the depot. Vehicles must first deliver equipment (linehaul) within setup time windows, then later collect the towers (backhaul), ensuring deliveries precede pickups. Route planning must respect vehicle capacities and strict timelines to avoid overloading while minimizing travel distance.
Reason: The problem description involves both linehaul and backhaul demands with the requirement that deliveries must precede pickups (B), time windows for installation (TW), and vehicle capacity constraints (C). Although the problem mentions vehicle capacities, the presence of backhaul and time window constraints takes precedence in classification. The problem does not mention distance limits (L) or open routes (O), and it specifies that backhaul can only be done after linehaul is completed (not mixed backhaul MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW'.

Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 73
Description: A solar panel installer services residential and commercial sites (<loc_customer>) with strict appointment windows (<time_windows>). Vehicles (<capacity>) carry new components for installation (linehaul) while simultaneously collecting defective parts for recycling (backhaul). The mixed backhaul requirement allows technicians to prioritize urgent installations or retrievals flexibly. Capacity constraints account for both outgoing equipment weight and incoming defective parts volume. Optimized routes reduce downtime for customers and ensure timely warranty processing.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), mixed backhaul (MB) where both linehaul and backhaul can be satisfied simultaneously, and capacity constraints (<capacity>). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'VRPMBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows. Although distance limits (L) are not explicitly mentioned, the capacity constraints imply some form of vehicle limitation, which is often associated with distance in practical scenarios. The presence of time windows and mixed backhaul are the most critical features here.

Description: Telecom teams urgently deploy satellite dishes to disaster zones (<loc_customer>) and later retrieve outdated equipment. Vehicles (<capacity>) start from a depot (<loc_depot>), with strict time windows (<time_windows>) during safe weather. Deployments must occur before pickups to prioritize connectivity restoration. Distance limits (<distance_limit>) account for rugged terrain fuel use. Routes can end at the last site or depot after pickups, ensuring equipment returns for reuse without overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are strict time windows (<time_windows>) during safe weather, which corresponds to 'TW'. Secondly, deployments must occur before pickups, indicating a backhaul demand ('B') where linehaul (deployments) must be satisfied before backhaul (pickups). Thirdly, there are distance limits (<distance_limit>) due to rugged terrain fuel use, which corresponds to 'L'. Lastly, routes can end at the last site or depot, suggesting an open route ('O') is possible but not mandatory. Given these features, the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW', which includes backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: A public health agency needs to deliver medical testing kits, PPE, and signage to event venues (linehaul) ahead of large gatherings, with setup time windows aligned with crowd arrival times. After events, they must retrieve the equipment (backhaul) without returning to the depot. Vehicles must ensure deliveries precede pickups, stay within capacity, and adhere to strict time windows to avoid disrupting event operations.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demands (B) that must be satisfied only after all linehaul demands are met, time window constraints (TW) for deliveries and pickups, and the vehicles do not return to the depot (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A fishing cooperative must transport fresh seafood from coastal docks to inland markets. The central processing plant is at <loc_depot>, and markets are at <loc_customer>. Each refrigerated truck has a capacity of <capacity> kg and must return within <distance_limit> km to prevent spoilage. Each market requires <demand> kg of seafood. Ensure all deliveries are made without exceeding vehicle limits.
Reason: The problem description includes a distance limit for the vehicles ('L') and does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, which suggests an open route ('O'). There is no mention of backhaul demand or time windows, so 'B' and 'TW' are not considered. The most specific variant that matches the given constraints is 'OVRPL'.

Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 79
Description: A research consortium supplies remote Arctic stations (<loc_customer>) via tracked vehicles during a brief ice-road season. The depot (<loc_depot>) must dispatch trucks with a maximum payload capacity (<capacity> tons) to deliver winter provisions. Each station’s window (<time_windows>) closes as ice melts, requiring precise timing. Additionally, vehicles cannot exceed a daily distance limit (<distance_limit> km) due to extreme cold and fuel scarcity. The goal is to ensure all stations are stocked before ice roads become impassable while avoiding vehicle breakdowns from overexertion.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple constraints: each station has a time window (<time_windows>) for delivery, vehicles have a daily distance limit (<distance_limit> km), and the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot (implied by the focus on delivering before ice roads become impassable, without mentioning returns). Additionally, there is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPLTW', which accounts for open routes, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: A construction firm dispatches trucks (capacity: `<capacity>`) from a storage yard (`<loc_depot>`) to deliver materials (e.g., cement `<demand_linehaul>`) to `<num_customer>` sites (`<loc_customer>`) and haul away debris (`<demand_backhaul>`). Routes must balance delivery/pickup order (e.g., drop off materials at Site X, collect debris from Site Y) without exceeding capacity or `<distance_limit>` (due to fuel constraints). Drivers finish at their last site.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) where debris is collected after delivering materials, distance limits (L) due to fuel constraints, and open routes (O) since drivers finish at their last site. There is no mention of time windows (TW), so 'TW' is not included. The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'OVRPBL'.

Description: A movie studio coordinates equipment transfers between active filming locations (<loc_customer>) from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>). Trucks (capacity <capacity>) deliver specialized gear (<demand_linehaul>) while collecting unused props (<demand_backhaul>), with flexible stop order to accommodate shooting schedules. Routes are limited to <distance_limit> km due to union driver shift rules. Vehicles remain on-site after final delivery for next-day crew use.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B') where unused props are collected after delivering specialized gear, distance limits ('L') due to union driver shift rules, and open routes ('O') since vehicles remain on-site after final delivery and do not return to the depot. There is no mention of time windows ('TW') or mixed backhaul ('MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 10
Description: An online retailer must deliver new merchandise to customers while simultaneously collecting returned items for resell or recycling. Delivery trucks (with a <capacity> kg capacity) start at the warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering packages to <num_customer> locations (<loc_customer>) with specific order weights (<demand_linehaul>). After completing all deliveries, the same trucks must proceed to designated return points (backhaul customers) to collect returned goods (<demand_backhaul>). The route must ensure deliveries precede pickups to prevent overloading during the return phase. Additionally, each truck’s total travel distance must stay under a <distance_limit> km limit to avoid driver fatigue and ensure efficient fuel use. The goal is to minimize total distance while respecting capacity and distance constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, and vehicles have distance limits (L). There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O), and the backhaul is not mixed (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBL', which combines backhaul and distance limit constraints.

Description: A municipal kitchen (<loc_depot>) prepares and delivers meals to <num_customer> schools (<loc_customer>), while also collecting food waste for composting. Each school has a meal demand (<demand_linehaul>), waste pickup requirement (<demand_backhaul>), and a lunchtime service window (<time_windows>). Refrigerated trucks (<capacity>) must complete routes within <distance_limit> km to maintain food safety. The challenge is to balance meal freshness (early deliveries) with waste collection efficiency, avoiding vehicle overloads.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). The backhaul demand is specified as waste pickup requirement, which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand (meal deliveries) are completed, indicating a backhaul (B) rather than mixed backhaul (MB) scenario. The vehicles have distance limits (L) and there are time window constraints (TW) for service at each school. There is no mention of open routes (O), so the vehicles are assumed to return to the depot. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.

Description: *Description:*  
A vertical farming company delivers fresh produce to restaurants (<loc_customer>) and picks up compost waste (mixed backhaul) from the same locations using refrigerated trucks (<capacity> kg). Restaurants specify narrow delivery windows (<time_windows>) to align with kitchen prep schedules. Trucks depart from the urban farm (<loc_depot>) and finish routes at waste processing plants (open routes). Routes are constrained by perishability-driven duration limits (<time_limit> hours) to ensure freshness. Demand includes both produce delivery (<demand_linehaul>) and compost collection (<demand_backhaul>).
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhaul (MB) where both produce delivery (linehaul) and compost collection (backhaul) can be satisfied simultaneously, time windows (TW) for restaurant deliveries, and open routes (O) where trucks finish at waste processing plants instead of returning to the depot. The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPMBTW'.

Description: A city’s urban agriculture initiative delivers compostable planting materials, seeds, and tools to community gardens (linehaul) across neighborhoods. Later, they collect organic waste and compost from the gardens (backhaul). Each garden operates during specific hours (time windows), and delivery vehicles must prioritize drop-offs before pickups. The capacity (<capacity>) of each truck must accommodate both outbound supplies and inbound compost. The routes should end at the final garden visited, avoiding unnecessary return trips to the central depot.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul (B) where compost is collected after delivering supplies, time windows (TW) for each garden's operating hours, and open routes (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot. The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows. Although distance limits (L) are not explicitly mentioned, the problem implies constraints on vehicle capacity and route feasibility, which often accompany distance considerations in such problems.

Description: An automotive rental firm delivers leased vehicles (linehaul) to customers’ homes or offices by scheduled appointment times (TW). After the rental period ends, the same vehicles are picked up (backhaul) from return locations. Each truck can carry a limited number of vehicles (capacity), and routes must stay within a maximum daily distance to avoid driver fatigue and ensure timely pickups/drop-offs. The challenge is to coordinate delivery and return schedules, respect customer time windows, and optimize vehicle utilization without overextending drivers.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW). Additionally, the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot after completing their routes, which suggests an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: Rangers in a national park distribute animal feed (<demand_linehaul>) to remote stations (<loc_customer>) while collecting confiscated traps and poaching evidence (<demand_backhaul>). Off-road vehicles (capacity <capacity>) start from a ranger post (<loc_depot>), with routes limited by fuel range (<distance_limit>). Deliveries and collections are sequenced based on real-time wildlife activity reports. Patrols end at their final station to maintain a presence in high-risk areas.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) where confiscated traps and poaching evidence are collected after delivering animal feed, distance limits (L) due to fuel range constraints, and open routes (O) since patrols end at their final station instead of returning to the depot. There is no mention of time window constraints (TW), so 'TW' is not included. The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'OVRPBL'.

Description: A diagnostic lab dispatches mobile units from a central facility (`<loc_depot>`) to:  
1. Deliver medical supplies to clinics (`<demand_linehaul>`).  
2. Collect lab samples from the same clinics (`<demand_backhaul>`).  
Units (capacity: `<capacity>`) must adhere to:  
- **Time windows** (`<time_windows>`): Clinics have strict sample collection hours (e.g., 9–11 AM).  
- **Distance limits** (`<distance_limit>`): Units cannot exceed 200 km/day due to refrigeration limits.  
- **Mixed backhauls**: A unit might deliver supplies to Clinic A, then collect samples from Clinic B.  
*Goal*: Ensure all clinics are served within constraints while minimizing fleet size.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhauls ('MB'), distance limits ('L'), and time windows ('TW'). The 'MB' feature allows both linehaul and backhaul demands to be satisfied simultaneously, which is a key aspect of the problem. Additionally, the vehicles have distance limits ('L') and must adhere to time windows ('TW'). There is no mention of the vehicles not returning to the depot, so the 'O' (open route) variants are not applicable. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPMBLTW'.

Description: A construction company needs to deliver building supplies to active job sites (<loc_customer>) and collect construction waste for recycling. Each truck (<capacity> ton capacity) starts at the central depot (<loc_depot>), first delivering materials to sites during their operational hours (time windows <time_windows>). After completing deliveries, trucks must return to the same route to pick up pre-sorted waste from the same sites. The challenge is to sequence routes so deliveries precede pickups, respect site-specific time windows, and avoid overloading trucks while ending tours at the final stop.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) where trucks must first deliver materials before picking up waste, time window constraints (TW) for site operational hours, and capacity constraints (C) for the trucks. The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'VRPBTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows. The problem does not mention distance limits (L), open routes (O), or mixed backhaul (MB), so these are not included in the selected variant.

Description: A wind farm operator must send maintenance crews to service offshore turbines. Each turbine requires a specific set of tools and crew members (<demand>), and can only be accessed during tidal windows (<time_windows>). Maintenance vessels (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a coastal depot (<loc_depot>), must return before depleting fuel (<distance_limit> km), and must prioritize urgent repairs. Routes must ensure all turbines are serviced within their operational windows while avoiding excessive travel for crews.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. The mention of 'tidal windows (<time_windows>)' indicates the presence of time window constraints (TW). The requirement for maintenance vessels to return before depleting fuel (<distance_limit> km) suggests distance limits (L). Additionally, the problem involves servicing turbines with specific demands, but there is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, nor is there any indication that vehicles do not have to return to the depot (O is not present). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the description is 'VRPLTW', which combines distance limits and time window constraints.

3) Perform emergency maintenance (service_time) at malfunctioning units  
Machines in high-security buildings have narrow service windows, requiring precise scheduling that interleaves restocking and collection tasks without exceeding vehicle weight limits.
Reason: The problem description includes capacity constraints (<capacity>), backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>), linehaul demand (<demand_linehaul>), time windows (<time_windows>), and the possibility of mixed backhaul (interleaving restocking and collection tasks). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'VRPMBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Linehaul, and Time Windows.

Description: A seafood company services offshore oyster farms (<loc_customer>) from coastal ports (<loc_depot>) using boats (capacity <capacity>). Vessels alternate between delivering feed sacks (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieving harvested crates (<demand_backhaul>), ending routes at the last farm serviced. Maximum route distances of <distance_limit> nautical miles are enforced for fuel safety in open waters.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and open routes (O) where vessels end at the last farm serviced. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches these features is 'OVRPBL'.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 76
Description: A furniture rental company services urban clients (<loc_customer>) from a warehouse (<loc_depot>) using trucks with limited cargo space (<capacity>). Each stop involves either delivering new furniture (linehaul) or collecting expired rentals (backhaul), with mixed sequencing allowed. Installation teams have fixed time windows (<time_windows>) at each location based on customer availability, and each service takes a predetermined time (<service_time>). Routes must be completed within driver shift limits (<time_limit>). The objective is to minimize operational costs while meeting all scheduling commitments.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed sequencing of linehaul and backhaul (MB), time windows (TW), and capacity constraints (C). Since MB and TW are present, the capacity constraint is ignored in favor of the more specific features. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBTW, which accounts for mixed backhaul and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 73
Description: A security provider deploys equipment (linehaul) to event venues before setup deadlines (TW) and retrieves gear (backhaul) after the event concludes (TW). Vehicles (C) must carry bulky equipment efficiently. Routes are constrained by distance limits (L) to ensure rapid deployment. Drivers start at the depot, deliver gear, then collect it afterward, ending at the depot for storage—avoiding extra trips to optimize resource use.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). Additionally, the vehicles must return to the depot, so it is not an open route (O is not present). The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, so it is not mixed backhaul (MB is not present). Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 12
Description: During a natural disaster, relief teams must deliver emergency supplies to affected areas (linehaul) and later retrieve deployed equipment (e.g., generators, tents) for redistribution or storage (backhaul). Each affected zone has a critical time window for receiving supplies, and equipment pickups must follow post-assessment timelines. Rescue vehicles (<capacity>) are limited by a <distance_limit> due to fuel shortages and terrain constraints. Routes must prioritize urgent deliveries first while ensuring equipment retrieval aligns with evolving operational needs without exceeding vehicle capacities.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B'), distance limits ('L'), and time window constraints ('TW'). Additionally, the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot, indicating an open route ('O'). The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Label: VRPMB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 19
Description: An educational supplier delivers new textbooks, stationery, and supplies to schools while collecting used textbooks and outdated materials for recycling or redistribution. Each truck must not exceed its capacity <capacity> when combining deliveries and pickups. Stops can be arranged in any sequence to optimize routes. The depot and 20 school locations are at <locs>, with supply demands <demand_linehaul> and textbook pickup requirements <demand_backhaul>. The objective is to plan efficient routes that ensure timely delivery and collection without overloading vehicles.  
```
Reason: The problem description includes both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) demands, with the constraint that trucks must not exceed their capacity. The backhaul (pickup) can only be done after all linehaul (delivery) is completed, which matches the 'B' (backhaul) feature. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), or open routes ('O'), so these features are not considered. The most specific variant that fits this description is 'VRPB' (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 11
Description: A manufacturing supplier delivers raw materials to factories (linehaul) and collects scrap metal from them (backhaul). Factories require deliveries during daytime shifts (time windows) and allow pickups only after production hours end. Trucks must prioritize deliveries to meet production schedules, then collect scrap without exceeding their <capacity> ton limit. Routes end at the final customer site to avoid unnecessary return trips.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met, time window constraints (TW) for deliveries and pickups, and open routes (O) where trucks end at the final customer site without returning to the depot. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 16
Description: An electronics retailer delivers new appliances to customers' homes (linehaul) and collects outdated devices for recycling (backhaul). Each delivery vehicle has a capacity limit for both outgoing and incoming loads. Deliveries must occur during customers' specified time windows (e.g., daytime for appliance setup), followed by pickups after the customer has prepared the old devices. Routes must not exceed a set distance to ensure drivers can complete tasks within a single shift. The goal is to optimize routes so all deliveries and pickups are completed efficiently without exceeding capacity or time/distance constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demands (B), distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW). Additionally, the backhaul demands can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). The vehicles must return to the depot, so 'O' (open route) is not applicable. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW', which includes backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 45
Description: A mobile dental clinic provides services to schools and nursing homes while collecting used equipment for sterilization. Each location (<loc_customer>) has a time window (<time_windows>) for visits, and the clinic van (capacity <capacity>) must deliver clean tools and collect used ones in any order. Routes are constrained by a maximum daily operating duration (<distance_limit>) to ensure staff shifts are compliant.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), distance limits (<distance_limit>), and backhaul demands (collecting used equipment). The backhaul demands can be satisfied in any order, which suggests a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario. Additionally, the vehicles have distance limits (L) and time window constraints (TW). There is no mention of the vehicles needing to return to the depot, which implies an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW'.

Label: OVRPTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 28
Description: A film production company redistributes camera gear, lighting rigs, and sets between multiple filming locations (<loc_customer>). Equipment demands (<demand>) vary per site, and trucks (<capacity>) must avoid overloading to prevent damage. Crews require gear by specific call times (<time_windows>), and vehicles end their routes at the final location to minimize downtime between shoots.
Reason: The problem description mentions that vehicles end their routes at the final location (open route, 'O'), there are equipment demands that vary per site (backhaul, 'B'), and crews require gear by specific call times (time windows, 'TW'). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 82
Description: A film production company requires trucks to deliver construction materials (e.g., sets, props) to remote filming locations and later remove debris. Deliveries must occur first to enable set assembly, followed by debris pickup. Each location has time windows tied to shooting schedules, and trucks cannot exceed a daily distance limit due to crew shift constraints. The vehicles must also balance payloads between heavy materials and bulky waste without overloading.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) as debris pickup must occur after deliveries, distance limits (L) due to crew shift constraints, and time windows (TW) tied to shooting schedules. Additionally, the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot after debris pickup, indicating an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A food distribution hub at <loc_depot> coordinates daily routes for electric vans (capacity <capacity>) to deliver fresh groceries to urban supermarkets (<loc_customer>) while simultaneously collecting unsold perishables for donation to food banks. Each supermarket has a delivery window (<time_windows>) and varying demands (<demand_linehaul> for deliveries, <demand_backhaul> for pickups). Routes must dynamically sequence pickups and deliveries (e.g., collect from Store A before delivering to Store B) while respecting both capacity limits and strict time constraints to prevent food spoilage.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demands (<demand_backhaul>), and the need to dynamically sequence pickups and deliveries, which suggests a mixed backhaul scenario (MB). Additionally, there is no mention of vehicles needing to return to the depot, implying open routes (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW', which includes open routes (O), mixed backhaul (MB), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).

Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 78
Description: A service provider circulates high-end amenities (linens, toiletries) to luxury hotels (<demand_linehaul>) while collecting used items for laundering (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have temperature-controlled compartments (<capacity>) and must adhere to hotels' strict delivery windows (<time_windows>) to avoid disrupting guest services. The MB flexibility enables routes like: deliver fresh towels to Hotel X → pick up dirty linens from Hotel Y → drop off new robes at Hotel Z.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhaul (MB) where both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, time windows (TW) for deliveries, and capacity constraints (C). However, since MB and TW are present, the capacity constraint is ignored in the classification. There is no mention of distance limits (L) or open routes (O), so these are not included. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 51
Description: A film production company needs to deliver camera gear, lighting rigs, and props (linehaul) to multiple filming locations, each with strict time windows aligned with shooting schedules. After scenes are completed, they must retrieve the equipment (backhaul) for reuse on subsequent sets. Trucks must not exceed their capacity limits, balancing the weight of deliveries and pickups. Routes are designed to end at the final pickup location, avoiding unnecessary returns to base. The challenge is to ensure deliveries arrive before shoot times, pickups occur after wrap-ups, and vehicle loads remain within constraints while optimizing route efficiency.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple key features: backhaul demand (B), time windows (TW), and open routes (O) where trucks do not return to the base after the final pickup. Additionally, there are capacity constraints (C), but these are secondary to the other features. The most specific variant that captures all these elements is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes, backhaul, distance limits (implied by the need to balance loads and avoid unnecessary returns), and time windows.

Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 21
Description: A clothing brand uses trucks (<capacity>) to deliver new seasonal inventory to retail stores (<loc_customer>) during designated restocking hours (<time_windows>). Stores may also require same-day pickup of unsold out-of-season items (<demand_backhaul>) for redistribution to outlet centers. Routes must dynamically mix deliveries and pickups, respecting store operating hours and vehicle capacity. Optimization focuses on reducing idle time and maximizing truck utilization.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>) which can be satisfied simultaneously with deliveries (mixed backhaul), and vehicle capacity (<capacity>). The most specific variant that matches these features is 'VRPMBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhauls, capacity constraints, and Time Windows.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 91
Description: Medical laboratories need to deliver specialized diagnostic equipment to remote clinics (linehaul) and collect blood or tissue samples (backhaul) for analysis. Each sample has a strict time window (<time_windows>) to preserve viability, requiring precise scheduling. Trucks (capacity <capacity>) must first deliver equipment before proceeding to pickup sites, as samples cannot wait in a loaded vehicle. Routes conclude at the lab’s processing facility, not the origin depot, to streamline sample analysis. The goal is to minimize delays while adhering to capacity limits and ensuring all stops are serviced within their critical timeframes.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, time window constraints (TW) for sample viability, and the routes conclude at the lab’s processing facility, not the origin depot, indicating an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Label: CVRP, Predicted: OVRP, Index: 74
Description: A city’s public art initiative requires delivering large outdoor sculptures from an art warehouse (<loc_depot>) to plazas and parks (<loc_customer>). Each sculpture has a unique size and weight, and specialized trucks have a maximum capacity of <capacity> cubic meters. The challenge is to plan routes that ensure all sculptures are placed in their designated locations without exceeding vehicle space limits. The goal is to minimize the total distance driven while accommodating the irregular shapes and sizes of the artworks.
Reason: The problem description involves delivering sculptures from a depot to various locations without mentioning the need for vehicles to return to the depot, which suggests an open route (O). Additionally, there is a capacity constraint (C) mentioned regarding the maximum capacity of the trucks. There are no mentions of backhaul (B), distance limits (L), or time windows (TW). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRP' (Open Vehicle Routing Problem) with capacity constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 12
Description: A events company sets up decorative structures at venues (linehaul) and removes them afterward (backhaul). Venues specify setup and teardown time windows (e.g., setup must finish by 4 PM, removal starts at 11 PM). Trucks must first deliver and install decorations, then return to the same locations later to collect materials. Each truck’s <capacity> cubic meters must accommodate both outbound setups and inbound removals, with routes concluding at the last teardown site.
Reason: The problem description involves backhaul demands (B) where trucks must first deliver and install decorations (linehaul) and then return to the same locations later to collect materials (backhaul). Additionally, there are time window constraints (TW) specified by the venues for both setup and teardown. The problem does not mention distance limits (L) or open routes (O), and the backhaul is not mixed (MB) since backhaul can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW'.

Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 58
Description: A research institute coordinates vessels (<capacity> storage) from port (<loc_depot>) to service <num_customer> ocean monitoring buoys (<loc_customer>). Some buoys need sensor deliveries (<demand_linehaul>), others require data retrieval (<demand_backhaul>). Each vessel's route must stay under <distance_limit> nautical miles due to fuel limits. Mixed sequences are allowed (e.g., deliver to Buoy A before retrieving from Buoy B), provided weight limits aren't exceeded mid-route.
Reason: The problem involves mixed sequences of deliveries and retrievals (mixed backhaul 'MB'), distance limits ('L'), and does not explicitly mention the need for vehicles to return to the depot (open route 'O'). There are no time window constraints mentioned. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBL' which accounts for open routes, mixed backhauls, and distance limits.

Description: A film production company must deliver cameras, lighting rigs, and props to remote filming locations (linehaul) within tight time windows dictated by actor availability and scene schedules. After filming concludes, equipment must be retrieved (backhaul) without returning to the central depot. Vehicles must optimize routes to avoid overloading while ensuring deliveries occur before pickups to meet production deadlines.
Reason: The problem description involves backhaul demands (B) where equipment must be retrieved after deliveries are made, time window constraints (TW) dictated by actor availability and scene schedules, and open routes (O) since vehicles do not return to the central depot after backhaul. The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes, backhaul demands, distance limits (though not explicitly mentioned, distance optimization is implied by route optimization), and time windows.

Description: A gardening company supplies customers with soil, mulch, and plants while collecting organic waste like leaves and grass clippings for composting. Each truck must manage deliveries and pickups within its capacity <capacity>, allowing stops to be sequenced in any order. The depot and 20 customer locations are at <locs>, with supply demands <demand_linehaul> and compost pickup needs <demand_backhaul>. The aim is to create routes that maximize load utilization and minimize travel time while serving all customers efficiently.
Reason: The problem description involves both linehaul (deliveries of soil, mulch, and plants) and backhaul (pickups of organic waste) demands. The backhaul demand can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), or open routes ('O'), so these features are not considered. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPB'.

Description: A mobile library service uses buses (capacity: <capacity>) to distribute requested books (<demand_linehaul>) from a central library (<loc_depot>) to neighborhood stops (<loc_customer>) and collect returns (<demand_backhaul>). Stops are active only during specific 1-hour slots (<time_windows>) (e.g., 10–11 AM at Stop A, 2–3 PM at Stop B). Routes must interweave drop-offs and pickups (e.g., deliver books at Stop 1, pick up returns at Stop 2) while respecting bus capacity (e.g., returned books occupy space for new loans).
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) that can be satisfied simultaneously with linehaul demand (MB), time window constraints (TW), and capacity constraints (C). Since the problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) and time windows (TW), the most specific variant is 'VRPMBLTW'. The capacity constraint is implied but not the primary distinguishing feature given the other constraints.

Description: A winery delivers wine bottles (linehaul) to retail stores (<loc_customer>) and collects grape pomace (backhaul) from vineyards for composting. Trucks with a <capacity> kg limit must first complete all deliveries to ensure freshness, then proceed to vineyards for waste pickup. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius of the central warehouse (<loc_depot>) to maintain refrigeration for perishable items and reduce emissions. The winery aims to optimize fuel costs and logistical efficiency while adhering to strict capacity and distance restrictions.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul deliveries are completed, and distance limits (L) for the routes. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O), and the backhaul is not mixed (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBL'.

Description: A museum's outreach program sends educational kits to schools (<loc_customer>) using vans that depart from the museum (<loc_depot>). Each van carries fragile exhibits (<capacity> kg) and must arrive during school hours (<time_windows>). Some stops require collecting previous kits (backhaul) while others only need deliveries, with sequence flexibility. Drivers work maximum 5-hour shifts (<duration_limit>) to ensure kit quality. The challenge is to coordinate this mixed delivery/pickup operation while respecting time constraints and vehicle capacities.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) where both deliveries and pickups can be satisfied simultaneously with sequence flexibility, time windows (TW) for school hours, and a duration limit (L) for driver shifts. The vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot after the last stop, but this is not explicitly stated, so we assume a standard VRP where vehicles return to the depot. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBLTW, which includes mixed backhaul, distance (duration) limits, and time windows.

Vehicles (capacity <capacity>) depart from a temporary depot (<loc_depot>), operate on open routes (O), and must complete missions within safety-driven distance limits (<distance_limit>).
Reason: The problem description includes open routes (O), backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). Additionally, the backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: An aviation maintenance company dispatches trucks to deliver replacement aircraft parts (linehaul) to airports (<loc_customer>) and later collect used or defective components (backhaul) for recycling. Each truck’s <capacity> kg limit must accommodate both outgoing parts and returned materials. Deliveries must precede pickups to ensure planes are serviced promptly. Furthermore, each truck’s route cannot exceed a <distance_limit> km limit to comply with flight crew schedules and avoid overnight travel. The depot (<loc_depot>) coordinates routes to minimize total distance while ensuring all parts are delivered and retrieved without violating constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which must be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met, distance limits (L) for each truck's route, and no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches these constraints is 'VRPBL'.

Description: A catering company provides equipment (tables, chairs, decor) for events at diverse venues. Equipment must be delivered before event start times (<time_windows>) and retrieved after the event concludes. Trucks must first deploy equipment to each venue, then return later to collect it. Time windows are critical: late deliveries risk event disruptions, while early pickups may violate venue agreements. Vehicles have capacity (<capacity>) constraints to balance the weight of outbound equipment and inbound returns, ensuring efficient routing and compliance with venue schedules.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints ('TW') for deliveries and pickups, as well as backhaul demands ('B') where equipment must be picked up after being delivered. The vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot after completing their routes, which suggests an open route ('O'). Additionally, there are capacity constraints ('C'), but these are secondary to the other features present. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBTW', which combines open routes, backhaul demands, and time window constraints.

Transport vehicles (<capacity>) depart from a distribution hub (<loc_depot>) and can sequence pickups/deliveries freely. Routes are constrained to <distance_limit> km to ensure produce freshness. The system must balance harvest collection with new seed distribution while optimizing fleet utilization.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (harvest pickups) and linehaul (seed deliveries) demands that can be sequenced freely, indicating a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario. Additionally, there is a distance limit (L) constraint on the routes. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O), so these are not considered. The most specific variant that matches these features is VRPMBL.

Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 2
Description: An automotive supplier delivers engine components to <num_customer> assembly plants. Each plant has a production schedule with a time window <time_windows> for part delivery, and requires a specific quantity (<demand>). Delivery trucks (<capacity> ton capacity) must reach each plant on time without exceeding a <distance_limit> km route length to align with just-in-time workflows. The supplier’s warehouse <loc_depot> must optimize routes to meet strict timing, prevent overloading, and ensure no truck exceeds its distance limit, which could delay downstream production.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows ('TW') for part delivery, distance limits ('L') for the trucks, and does not mention any requirement for the trucks to return to the depot, which suggests an open route ('O'). There is no mention of backhaul demand ('B' or 'MB'), so those features are not considered. The presence of 'TW', 'L', and 'O' makes 'OVRPLTW' the most specific and appropriate variant.

Description: A specialty coffee company operates mobile roasting units that visit urban cafes (<loc_customer>) to deliver freshly roasted beans (<demand_linehaul>) and collect used coffee grounds (<demand_backhaul>) for composting. Each vehicle (<capacity>) starts at the roastery (<loc_depot>) and can sequence deliveries/pickups freely. Routes must account for electric vehicle range limits (<distance_limit>), with drivers ending their shift at the final location. The challenge is to maximize daily stops while balancing bean delivery and waste collection loads.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) where used coffee grounds are collected after delivering freshly roasted beans, distance limits (L) due to electric vehicle range constraints, and open routes (O) since drivers end their shift at the final location without returning to the depot. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or the requirement to satisfy linehaul demand before backhaul (which would suggest 'B' instead of 'MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 69
Description: A security firm deploys barriers, cameras, and monitoring systems to venues hosting high-profile events. Trucks (<capacity> kg) must deliver equipment ahead of event start times (<time_window>), then retrieve gear immediately after the event concludes. Delivery routes prioritize venues with earlier start times, while pickups follow strict post-event schedules to avoid congestion. The <service_time> includes setup and takedown coordination with event staff, ensuring all equipment is secured before departing for the final stop.
Reason: The problem description involves time window constraints (<time_window>) for deliveries and pickups, as well as backhaul demand (retrieving gear after the event). The backhaul demand must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand (deliveries) is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature. Additionally, the time window constraints are explicitly mentioned, corresponding to the 'TW' feature. There is no mention of vehicles not returning to the depot ('O'), distance limits ('L'), or mixed backhaul ('MB'). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPBTW'.

Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile clinics to deliver vaccinations and basic care to underserved communities while collecting biohazard waste (e.g., used syringes) from local clinics. Vehicles (capacity: `<capacity>`) depart from a central depot (`<loc_depot>`) to visit `<num_customer>` sites (`<loc_customer>`). Each stop has a time window (`<time_windows>`) for service (e.g., school hours for vaccinations) and either requires medical supplies (`<demand_linehaul>`) or has waste for pickup (`<demand_backhaul>`). Routes must optimize the sequence of deliveries/pickups while respecting vehicle capacity and strict time windows for perishable vaccines.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows ('TW') for service at each stop, backhaul demand ('B') for waste pickup, and linehaul demand for medical supplies. The vehicles must respect vehicle capacity ('C') and strict time windows for perishable vaccines. The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which is characteristic of 'B' (backhaul) rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). There is no mention of distance limits ('L') or open routes ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW', which combines vehicle routing with backhaul and time window constraints.

Description: A race organizer must deliver water stations, first-aid kits, and directional signage to checkpoints along a marathon route (<loc_customer>). All equipment originates from a logistics hub (<loc_depot>). Each checkpoint has unique supply needs (<demand>), and delivery trucks cannot exceed their weight and space limits (<capacity>). The goal is to route vehicles efficiently to avoid overloading, cover all checkpoints, and allow drivers to conclude their routes at the final drop-off point.
Reason: The problem description mentions that delivery trucks cannot exceed their weight and space limits (<capacity>), which is a key feature of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). There is no mention of backhaul demand, distance limits, open routes, or time windows, so the most appropriate variant is CVRP.

Vehicles must first deliver gear to all locations, then return along the route to collect items, without overloading their capacity (<capacity>). Routes must be planned to avoid delays during peak traffic and ensure the last pickup location is the route’s endpoint.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering equipment) and backhaul (collecting equipment) demands, with backhaul only being satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there are time window constraints for both morning setup and evening pickup at each lodge. The vehicles do not need to return to the depot after the last pickup, making it an open route. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which combines open route (O), backhaul (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).

Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 18
Description: A foodservice supplier delivers cooking oil, spices, and kitchenware to restaurants while collecting used cooking oil for biodiesel production. The trucks (capacity <capacity>) begin at the central warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering fresh supplies to multiple eateries. After completing all deliveries, the same vehicles collect the used oil from the same locations. This ensures that the vehicle’s capacity is not exceeded during deliveries and that hazardous materials are handled safely in the return phase. The aim is to optimize routes for minimal fuel costs and environmental impact.
Reason: The problem involves delivering fresh supplies (linehaul) and then collecting used oil (backhaul) from the same locations, with the constraint that backhaul can only be satisfied after all linehaul deliveries are completed. This matches the 'B' (backhaul) feature. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), or open routes ('O'), so the most appropriate variant is 'VRPB'.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 78
Description: A catering company deploys food trucks from a commissary (<loc_depot>) to multiple festival locations (<loc_customer>). Each truck has limited ingredient capacity (<capacity>) and must complete its route before perishables expire (<time_limit>). Stops involve both delivering fresh supplies to satellite vendors (linehaul) and collecting unsold food for composting (backhaul), with flexible sequencing. Each festival location has strict vendor access windows (<time_windows>) and unloading takes variable time (<service_time>). The goal is to maximize freshness while minimizing fuel costs across all routes.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple features that need to be considered. Firstly, the trucks have limited ingredient capacity (<capacity>), which is a basic feature of CVRP. However, the description also mentions that stops involve both delivering fresh supplies (linehaul) and collecting unsold food for composting (backhaul), with flexible sequencing, which indicates a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario where both linehaul and backhaul can be satisfied simultaneously. Additionally, each festival location has strict vendor access windows (<time_windows>), indicating time window constraints (TW). There is no mention of the vehicles having to return to the depot, suggesting open routes (O). There is no mention of distance limits (L). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPMBTW'.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 10
Description: A recycling company must deliver new packaging materials to businesses (linehaul) and collect recyclables from the same locations (backhaul). Each business has strict operating hours (time windows) during which deliveries and pickups must occur. Trucks must deliver supplies first before collecting recyclables to avoid contamination. With a capacity limit of <capacity> kg, routes must balance outbound and inbound loads while ensuring no vehicle returns to the depot after completing all stops.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, time window constraints (TW), and open routes (O) where vehicles do not return to the depot after completing all stops. The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A marine telecom company maintains underwater internet cables and scientific monitoring stations across <num_customer> ocean coordinates (<loc_customer>). Repair ships depart from port (<loc_depot>) carrying both replacement cable segments (<demand_linehaul>) and specialized tools (<capacity>). During repairs, they simultaneously retrieve data pods from research stations (<demand_backhaul>) in any order. Each vessel has a maximum safe operating range of <distance_limit> nautical miles due to fuel constraints. Ships conclude missions at the last serviced location to await new assignments. The goal is to maintain critical infrastructure while minimizing total nautical miles traveled across the fleet.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (retrieving data pods from research stations), distance limits (maximum safe operating range due to fuel constraints), and open routes (ships conclude missions at the last serviced location). These features correspond to 'B', 'L', and 'O' in the variant definitions. Among the options, 'OVRPBL' is the most specific variant that includes all these features (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Distance Limits).

Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 41
Description: A festival organizer contracts logistics providers to deliver stages, power generators, and temporary structures to multiple event sites. Each site requires deliveries during a narrow morning window for setup, followed by a mandatory equipment retrieval phase after the festival concludes. Vehicles must prioritize linehaul deliveries (equipment deployment) before backhaul pickups (dismantling), ensuring capacity constraints are met for oversized loads. Time windows are critical: late arrivals delay setup, while early pickups risk violating venue contracts.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met, time window constraints (TW) for deliveries and pickups, and there is no mention of vehicles needing to return to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 86
Description: An indoor farming startup harvests produce at <loc_depot> and delivers to high-end restaurants (<loc_customer>) with strict delivery windows (<time_windows>) to align with prep schedules. Some restaurants also return compostable waste (<demand_backhaul>) during the same visit. Electric cargo bikes (<capacity>) optimize routes where deliveries and pickups are intermixed, ending at the last restaurant to avoid empty return trips. Service times (<service_time>) account for quality inspections during both drop-offs and collections.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>), and the vehicles do not return to the depot (ending at the last restaurant). Additionally, the backhaul and linehaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously (intermixed deliveries and pickups), which indicates mixed backhaul ('MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW', which includes open routes ('O'), mixed backhaul ('MB'), distance limits ('L' - implied by electric cargo bikes having limited range), and time windows ('TW').
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 47
Description: A smart city operator deploys electric trucks (`<capacity>`) to service IoT-enabled waste bins (`<loc_customer>`). Each bin has:  
- A time window (`<time_windows>`) based on historical overflow data.  
- Either waste for collection (`<demand_backhaul>`) or sensor maintenance needs (`<demand_linehaul>`).  
Routes must dynamically mix pickups (full bins) and deliveries (replacement sensors/parts), prioritizing bins nearing capacity during morning rush hours. Service times (`<service_time>`) vary for waste compaction vs. sensor repairs.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (`<time_windows>`), mixed backhaul (`<demand_backhaul>` and linehaul (`<demand_linehaul>`), and the routes must dynamically mix pickups and deliveries, which indicates mixed backhaul (MB). Additionally, there are time window constraints (TW) for service. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBLTW', which accounts for mixed backhaul, linehaul, and time windows.

Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 1
Description: A pharmaceutical company distributes lab samples to clinics (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieves used samples for analysis (<demand_backhaul>) using refrigerated vans (capacity: <capacity>). Vans depart from a lab (<loc_depot>) and must visit <num_customer> clinics (<loc_customer>), mixing deliveries and pickups in any order. Each route cannot exceed <distance_limit> km to maintain sample integrity. The goal is to minimize total distance while ensuring temperature-sensitive cargo is handled efficiently.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) demands that can be satisfied simultaneously (mixed backhaul), has distance limits for routes, and does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot (open route). There are no time window constraints mentioned. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBL' which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Distance Limits.

Description: A construction firm coordinates trucks to deliver materials to sites (<demand_linehaul>) and haul away debris (<demand_backhaul>) from the same locations (<loc_customer>). Vehicles (capacity <capacity>) depart from a storage yard (<loc_depot>) with distance limits (<distance_limit>) to comply with driver regulations. Sites enforce time windows (<time_windows>) for noise-sensitive areas. Trucks may finish at disposal facilities after debris pickups.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B'), distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), and the possibility of trucks finishing at disposal facilities (indicating open routes 'O'). The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.

Vans (<capacity> mailbag limit) start at a sorting center (<loc_depot>). Daily routes cannot exceed <distance_limit> km to meet shift schedules. Deliveries and collections are freely interleaved.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhaul ('MB') where deliveries and collections are freely interleaved, distance limits ('L') for daily routes, and no requirement for vehicles to return to the depot ('O'). There are no time window constraints mentioned, so 'TW' is not included. The most specific variant that matches these features is 'OVRPMBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 96
Description: A rail operator expands services temporarily and needs to install ticketing kiosks and boarding gates at stations. Each station has a setup time window to avoid disrupting regular operations. After the expansion, equipment must be retrieved. Vehicles must deliver gear (linehaul) to stations within their time windows, then return later to collect items (backhaul), ensuring deliveries come first. Routes must balance capacity limits and time constraints to maintain service schedules.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, time window constraints (TW) for setup and retrieval, and there is no mention of vehicles not returning to the depot (O is not present). The problem does not mention distance limits (L) or mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPBTW, which combines backhaul and time window constraints.

Description: A rooftop farm supplies fresh produce to high-end restaurants (<loc_customer>) with strict delivery windows (<time_windows>) for meal prep. Delivery trucks (capacity <capacity>) simultaneously collect unsold food waste (<demand_backhaul>) for composting. Routes mix deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) and pickups dynamically, ending near last stops to avoid empty return trips.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>), and linehaul demand (<demand_linehaul>). Additionally, the routes end near the last stops to avoid empty return trips, indicating an open route (O). The backhaul and linehaul demands are mixed dynamically, which suggests mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW', which includes open routes (O), mixed backhaul (MB), linehaul (L), and time windows (TW).

Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 17
Description: A healthcare provider sends vans to deliver medical equipment and vaccines (linehaul) to remote clinics and collects blood samples or diagnostic specimens (backhaul) for laboratory analysis. Each van has a limited capacity to accommodate both supplies and perishable biological materials. Deliveries must arrive before clinics’ operational hours end (time windows), and pickups follow to ensure samples are retrieved promptly. Routes are restricted by distance limits to avoid delays in rural areas with poor infrastructure. The objective is to balance load constraints, time windows, and route feasibility to maximize service efficiency.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). The backhaul is described as being collected after all linehaul deliveries are completed, which matches the 'B' (backhaul) feature. The vans have distance limits (L), and there are time window constraints (TW) for both deliveries and pickups. Therefore, the most specific variant that includes all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.

Description: A craft brewery services tap systems at <num_customer> bars (<loc_customer>), delivering fresh kegs (<demand_linehaul>) while retrieving empties (<demand_backhaul>) using refrigerated trucks (capacity <capacity>). Bars mandate service during pre-opening hours (<time_windows>) to avoid disrupting operations, with each stop requiring <service_time> for quality checks. The mixed nature of deliveries and pickups allows for flexible sequencing, but perishability constraints require completion of all routes within <max_route_duration>.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B'), time windows ('TW'), and mixed backhaul ('MB') where both linehaul and backhaul demand can be satisfied simultaneously. Additionally, there is a constraint on the maximum route duration, which can be interpreted as a distance limit ('L'). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPMBLTW'.

Description: A city deploys technician teams to calibrate temporary traffic sensors before major events. Vans (capacity <capacity> sensors) start at the DOT yard (<loc_depot>), delivering new sensors (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieving expired ones (<demand_backhaul>) at intersections (<loc_customer>). Calibration must occur during low-traffic windows (<time_windows>). Routes respect daily overtime limits (<time_limit> hours), with vans parked near last job sites.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (retrieving expired sensors), linehaul demand (delivering new sensors), time windows (calibration during low-traffic windows), and open routes (vans parked near last job sites). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, and Time Windows.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 15
Description: A company organizes temporary pop-up events at multiple locations (<loc_customer>) across the city. They need to deliver event equipment like tents and stages (linehaul) to each site before the event starts, adhering to strict setup deadlines (<time_windows>). After the event concludes, they must collect the equipment (backhaul) for reuse. Vehicles depart from the central warehouse (<loc_depot>), must not exceed their carrying capacity (<capacity>), and complete their routes ending at the final pickup point. Deliveries must precede pickups to ensure setups are complete before teardown begins, all while respecting the time windows for both phases.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is satisfied, time window constraints (TW) for both deliveries and pickups, and does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot (O is not present). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches these features is 'VRPBTW'.

Description: An IT services company must deploy mobile Wi-Fi hotspots to various festival venues (<loc_customer>) from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>). Each truck carries equipment (<capacity> units) and has 6-hour deployment windows (<time_windows>) before events begin. Technicians both install routers (linehaul) and later retrieve them (backhaul), with operations potentially mixed at multi-day events. Vehicles cannot exceed 200km daily routes (<distance_limit>) due to maintenance requirements. The goal is to service all venues while optimizing equipment transfers and minimizing fleet mileage.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple features that need to be considered: 1) vehicles have distance limits (L), 2) there are time window constraints (TW), and 3) the operations involve both linehaul and backhaul demands that can be satisfied simultaneously (MB). The presence of 'MB' (mixed backhaul) takes precedence over simple 'B' (backhaul), and the combination of 'MB', 'L', and 'TW' leads to the most specific variant 'VRPMBLTW'.

Description: A health agency deploys mobile units (capacity <capacity>) from a depot (<loc_depot>) to administer tests (<demand_backhaul>) and deliver vaccines (<demand_linehaul>) to clinics (<loc_customer>). Each clinic has a time window (<time_windows>) based on staff availability. Units may alternate between testing and vaccination stops (mixed sequencing) and remain at their last location for subsequent missions. The goal is to maximize daily coverage while respecting cold-chain storage limits and appointment schedules.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhaul (MB) as units can alternate between testing and vaccination stops, time windows (TW) for clinics based on staff availability, and the vehicles do not necessarily return to the depot (O) as they may remain at their last location for subsequent missions. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW' which includes open routes, mixed backhaul, distance limits (implied by cold-chain storage limits), and time windows.

Description: A manufacturing supplier services <num_customer> factories (<loc_customer>) from a distribution center (<loc_depot>). Vehicles deliver custom parts (<demand_linehaul>) and collect scrap metal (<demand_backhaul>) in any order, constrained by vehicle capacity (<capacity>). Factories impose strict time windows (<time_windows>) for deliveries to synchronize with production schedules. Routes must also respect a maximum duration (<time_limit>) to ensure driver shifts comply with labor laws. The aim is to reduce idle time at factories while optimizing fuel costs.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), time windows (TW), and vehicle capacity (C). The backhaul demand can be satisfied in any order with the linehaul demand, indicating a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario rather than strict backhaul (B). Additionally, there are time window constraints (TW) for deliveries. The problem does not mention open routes (O) or distance limits (L), so these are not considered. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBTW, which accounts for mixed backhaul, time windows, and capacity constraints.

Description: A blood bank must urgently deliver plasma units to hospitals during a disease outbreak. Each hospital has a critical time window (<time_windows>) for receiving shipments to ensure plasma viability, as delays could jeopardize patient care. Delivery vehicles are constrained by refrigeration capacity (<capacity> liters) and must complete all routes within a 12-hour shift (<distance_limit> km), as drivers cannot work beyond regulatory limits. The challenge is to plan routes that prioritize hospitals with the tightest deadlines, respect vehicle load limits, and ensure all deliveries occur within the imposed time and distance boundaries.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints (<time_windows>), vehicle capacity constraints (<capacity> liters), and distance limits (<distance_limit> km). The presence of time windows and distance limits suggests the use of 'TW' and 'L' variants. Additionally, the problem does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, which implies an open route ('O'). There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, so 'B' and 'MB' variants are not considered. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the description is 'OVRPLTW'.

Description: A utility company supplies liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders to residential areas (<loc_customer>). Empty cylinders are replaced with full ones at each location, and each delivery truck can carry a maximum of <capacity> cylinders. The depot (<loc_depot>) must plan routes to service all <num_customer> households, ensuring no truck overloads. The challenge is to balance cylinder distribution across vehicles and minimize travel distance, as cylinder weight and space constraints are critical.
Reason: The problem description involves delivering full LPG cylinders and picking up empty ones, which can be seen as a backhaul demand (B). Additionally, the problem mentions cylinder weight and space constraints, implying capacity constraints (C). There is no mention of distance limits (L), time windows (TW), or open routes (O). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls (VRPB).

Description: A renewable energy company operates a fleet of mobile cleaning units that service solar farms across a region. Each unit starts at a central hub (<loc_depot>), visits multiple solar installations (<loc_customer>) to perform cleaning (delivering cleaning fluid <demand_linehaul>) while collecting damaged panels for recycling (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have limited cleaning fluid capacity (<capacity>) and maximum daily operating range (<distance_limit>). Technicians finish their day at the last site without returning to base.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (collecting damaged panels) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand (delivering cleaning fluid) is satisfied ('B'), vehicles have distance limits ('L'), and technicians finish their day at the last site without returning to base ('O'). There is no mention of time window constraints ('TW'), so they are not considered. The most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBL'.

Description: A seafood company services offshore fish farms (<loc_customer>) from a coastal depot (<loc_depot>) using vessels (capacity: <capacity> tons). Each visit combines:  
- Delivering customized feed (<demand_linehaul>)  
- Collecting mature fish (<demand_backhaul>)  
Tidal conditions create strict time windows (<time_windows>) for dock access. Vessels must complete routes within <distance_limit> nautical miles while maintaining feed freshness and live harvest viability.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B'), distance limits ('L'), and time windows ('TW'). Additionally, the vessels do not necessarily have to return to the depot, indicating an open route ('O'). The backhaul demand can be satisfied simultaneously with linehaul demand, as the vessels both deliver feed and collect mature fish in the same visit, which suggests mixed backhaul ('MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW', which includes all these features.

Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile testing and vaccination units that must visit multiple locations (<loc_customer>) within strict time windows (<time_windows>) to administer tests/vaccines (<demand_linehaul>) and collect biohazard waste (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles (capacity <capacity>) can alternate between deliveries and pickups but must avoid exceeding capacity (e.g., vaccines + waste containers). Service times (<service_time>) include setup/cleanup. Late arrivals risk missing high-risk populations, while early arrivals waste resources waiting.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows ('TW'), backhaul demand ('B') which can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is satisfied, and capacity constraints ('C'). However, since 'TW' and 'B' are present, the 'C' is ignored. The description does not mention distance limits ('L') or open routes ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW', which combines backhaul demand and time window constraints.

Description: An agricultural logistics firm delivers farming equipment (tractors, harvesters) to rural farms (linehaul) and collects harvested crops (backhaul) for processing. Vehicles must deliver machinery before the harvest window (time constraints) and then collect crops immediately after. Each truck has a capacity limit for both equipment and crop loads. Routes are restricted by distance to ensure accessibility in remote areas. The challenge is to synchronize deliveries and pickups, ensuring farmers can begin harvesting promptly and crops are retrieved before spoilage, while respecting operational limits.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demands (B), distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW). The backhaul demands are specified to be satisfied only after all linehaul demands are met, which aligns with the 'B' variant. Additionally, there are distance restrictions (L) and time constraints (TW) for deliveries and pickups. Therefore, the most specific variant that captures all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.

Description: A company operates mobile electric vehicle (EV) charging stations that visit parking lots (<loc_customer>) to provide on-demand charging. Each station starts from a central depot (<loc_depot>) with fully charged batteries (<capacity> kWh). Some locations require battery swaps (pickups of depleted batteries <demand_backhaul>) while others need energy deliveries (<demand_linehaul>). Vehicles can serve locations in any order but must complete routes within <distance_limit> km due to operational constraints. The goal is to maximize served demand while minimizing total fleet mileage.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (energy deliveries) and backhaul (battery pickups) demands, which can be served in any order (mixed backhaul). Additionally, the vehicles have a distance limit. There is no mention of time windows or open routes (vehicles start and end at the depot). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBL' (Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Distance Limits).

Technicians replace faulty sensors (pickups) and deploy new units (deliveries) from a central hub (<loc_depot>). Each sensor has a maintenance time window (<time_windows>) based on criticality alerts. Electric service vans (<capacity>) must finish routes within <distance_limit> km due to battery constraints. Teams end shifts at the last serviced sensor location to minimize downtime.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, the vehicles do not return to the depot (end shifts at the last serviced sensor location), which corresponds to 'O' (open route). Second, there are both pickups (faulty sensors) and deliveries (new units), which aligns with 'B' (backhaul demand). Third, the vehicles have a distance limit due to battery constraints, which is 'L'. Finally, there are maintenance time windows for the sensors, which is 'TW'. Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Vehicles must deliver decor (linehaul) within time constraints, then return later to pick up items (backhaul), ensuring deliveries precede pickups. Capacity limits and timing are critical to avoid delays and logistical bottlenecks.
Reason: The problem description involves transporting items to venues (linehaul) and then picking them up later (backhaul), with strict time windows for both deliveries and pickups. This matches the 'B' (backhaul) and 'TW' (time window) attributes. Additionally, the vehicles must return to the depot after pickups, so it is not an open route ('O' is not applicable). There is no mention of distance limits ('L') or mixed backhaul ('MB'), so the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW' (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows).

Routes must stay within a maximum distance of <distance_limit> km to ensure drivers finish before dusk. The goal is to plan efficient routes that respect time windows, prevent overloading, and avoid unnecessary returns to the depot.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple constraints and features: time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>), distance limits (<distance_limit>), and capacity constraints (<capacity>). The backhaul demand must be satisfied only after all linehaul deliveries are completed, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature. The time windows and distance limits are also explicitly mentioned, corresponding to 'TW' and 'L' features. The problem does not mention open routes ('O') or mixed backhaul ('MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.

Description: Technicians install solar panels (<demand_linehaul>) at residential sites (<loc_customer>) during homeowner-specified windows (<time_windows>), while collecting faulty components (<demand_backhaul>) under warranty. Service vans (<capacity>) must dynamically interleave installations and pickups based on part availability and appointment constraints, ensuring no vehicle exceeds weight limits.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>), and capacity constraints (<capacity>). The backhaul demand can be interleaved with linehaul demand, indicating a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario. Additionally, the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBTW', which includes open routes, mixed backhaul, time windows, and capacity constraints.

Label: VRPBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 78
Description: A film production company is shooting in rugged mountainous terrain. Each day, trucks must deliver cameras, lighting rigs, and set props (<demand_linehaul>) to filming locations (<loc_customer>). After setup, they collect used props, discarded materials, and equipment for reuse or disposal (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have a limited capacity (<capacity>) to handle both deliveries and pickups. The mountainous roads impose a strict distance limit (<distance_limit>) on routes to prevent exceeding fuel reserves, as the nearest refueling station is hours away. The goal is to optimize routes so crews receive everything needed while efficiently repatriating waste without overloading trucks or straying beyond safe travel distances.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and does not mention the need for vehicles to return to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). There is no mention of time windows (TW), so that feature is not included. The most specific variant that matches these features is 'OVRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBL, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 47
Description: A precision farming service deploys drones to monitor crops and collects spent batteries for recharging. Drones are delivered (linehaul) to farms first, and empty battery pickups (backhaul) follow. Vehicles must not exceed capacity limits for both drones and batteries. Routes are constrained by distance to minimize travel time and maintain drone battery life for return trips.
Reason: The problem description involves both linehaul (delivering drones) and backhaul (collecting spent batteries) demands, with the constraint that backhaul can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there are capacity limits for both drones and batteries, and routes are constrained by distance to minimize travel time. The description does not mention time windows or open routes, so the most appropriate variant is 'VRPB' (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls).

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 9
Description: A healthcare logistics firm delivers sterilized medical tools to hospitals (<demand_linehaul>) and collects contaminated waste (<demand_backhaul>) for disposal. Each vehicle (<capacity> kg capacity) must reach hospitals during their designated restocking hours (<time_windows>), deliver supplies first, then pick up hazardous materials. The route must respect strict biohazard handling protocols, ensuring no pickups occur until deliveries are finalized. Trucks conclude their routes at the final hospital, optimizing fuel use and adhering to strict safety and timing constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is delivered, time windows (TW) for restocking hours, and the vehicles do not return to the depot (O) but conclude their routes at the final hospital. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 29
Description: A pharmaceutical company delivers temperature-sensitive biologics between research labs and clinical trial sites. Each site has rigid delivery time windows (TW) to maintain trial protocols. Refrigerated vehicles are limited by cargo capacity (C) due to cold storage requirements and must stay within a daily distance limit (L) to adhere to driver working-hour regulations. The goal is to design routes that honor all time constraints, avoid overloading trucks, and comply with distance limits to prevent delays in critical medical research timelines.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple constraints: time windows (TW) for delivery, cargo capacity (C) due to cold storage requirements, and distance limits (L) for vehicles. Since the problem involves time windows, capacity, and distance limits, the most specific variant that encompasses all these constraints is 'VRPBLTW'. The 'B' (backhaul) is not mentioned, so it is not included. The 'O' (open route) is also not mentioned, so the vehicles are assumed to return to the depot. Therefore, 'VRPBLTW' is the most appropriate variant.

Description: Following a major earthquake, construction crews must deliver reinforced steel beams and concrete additives to damaged urban areas. Each site (<loc_customer>) has a time window (<time_windows>) for material arrival to align with reconstruction schedules. Heavy-duty trucks (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a regional depot (<loc_depot>), but mountainous terrain limits their travel range (<distance_limit> km). Routes must prioritize timely delivery while avoiding overloading and ensuring no truck exceeds its maximum journey distance.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), distance limits (<distance_limit> km), and capacity constraints (<capacity> ton capacity). There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, nor is there any indication that the trucks do not have to return to the depot. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the description is the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Distance Limits (VRPLTW).

Description: A lunar logistics company must transport modular components to construction sites (<demand_linehaul>) and collect space debris (<demand_backhaul>) across the Moon’s surface (<loc_customer>). Rovers (capacity <capacity>) launch from a base (<loc_depot>) and can freely mix tasks (MB). Limited battery life restricts each route to <distance_limit> km. The challenge is to optimize paths while respecting capacity and range limits in a low-gravity environment.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) tasks where rovers can freely mix linehaul and backhaul tasks, distance limits (L) due to battery life restrictions, and the rovers do not necessarily have to return to the depot (O). There are no time window constraints mentioned. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBL' which accounts for open routes, mixed backhaul, and distance limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 14
Description: An automotive parts distributor supplies dealerships with new components (linehaul) and retrieves faulty or recalled parts (backhaul). Dealerships mandate delivery during business hours (time windows) and require pickups only after inspecting returned items. Trucks must deliver parts first to ensure inventory availability, then collect defective items without exceeding <capacity> cubic feet. Routes end at the last dealership to streamline operations.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, time window constraints (TW) for deliveries and pickups, and the routes end at the last dealership (O) without returning to the depot. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A preservation organization must deliver conservation tools, materials, and protective gear to remote archaeological sites scattered across a mountainous region. After completing deliveries (linehaul), vehicles must collect damaged artifacts for restoration at a central museum. Each vehicle has a maximum capacity, and routes must not exceed a strict distance limit to ensure safe operation without refueling. The goal is to plan efficient routes that first service all sites with supplies before retrieving artifacts, ensuring no vehicle overloads or exceeds its travel range.
Reason: The problem involves delivering supplies (linehaul) before collecting artifacts (backhaul), which is a backhaul demand ('B'). Additionally, vehicles have a maximum capacity ('C') and a strict distance limit ('L'). The problem does not mention time windows ('TW') or open routes ('O'), and the backhaul must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is met, which is characteristic of 'B' rather than 'MB'. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBL'.

Label: VRPTW, Predicted: OVRPTW, Index: 36
Description: A tech conference organizer needs to deploy servers to multiple venues for simultaneous workshops. Server delivery locations (<locs>) must align with venue setup schedules, with time windows <time_windows> to ensure readiness. Each venue requires <demand> servers, and service time <service_time> includes setup coordination. Delivery trucks can carry up to <capacity> servers and travel at <speed> km/h. The goal is to route trucks from the central staging area to all venues, respecting time constraints and maximizing server delivery efficiency.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints (<time_windows>) for server delivery, which aligns with the 'TW' feature. Additionally, the problem does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, suggesting an open route ('O'). There is no mention of backhaul demand ('B'), distance limits ('L'), or mixed backhaul ('MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPTW', which combines open routes with time window constraints.

Description: During multi-venue sporting events, broadcast crews require rapid equipment transfers between stadiums (<loc_customer>). Each venue has specific setup/teardown time windows (<time_windows>) for cameras and audio gear. Logistics vans (capacity <capacity>) transport gear from oversupplied venues (pickup <demand_backhaul>) to deficit venues (delivery <demand_linehaul>) in dynamically optimized sequences. Vehicles remain at their final venue for next-day operations.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), linehaul demand (L), time windows (TW), and specifies that vehicles remain at their final venue (O for open route). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, and Time Windows.

Description: An environmental NGO deploys boats from a coastal depot (<loc_depot>) to distribute recycling bins (<demand_linehaul>) to tourist beaches (<loc_customer>) while collecting ocean plastic waste (<demand_backhaul>). Each vessel has a payload limit (<capacity>) and must operate within strict nautical miles (<distance_limit>) due to fuel constraints. Boats finish routes at the last beach to avoid backtracking. The challenge is interleaving bin drop-offs and waste pickups efficiently across scattered islands.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (collecting ocean plastic waste) which can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand (distributing recycling bins) is satisfied, vehicles have distance limits (strict nautical miles), and the routes are open (boats finish routes at the last beach to avoid backtracking). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRPBL', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Distance Limits.

Description: A floral hub (<loc_depot>) supplies fresh flowers (<demand_linehaul>) to <num_customer> boutique florists (<loc_customer>) and retrieves reusable vases (<demand_backhaul>). Deliveries and pickups can be interleaved, but perishability limits route duration (<time_limit>). Each vehicle (<capacity>) must respect florists' opening hours (<time_windows>) and avoid detours exceeding <distance_limit> km to preserve flower freshness. The goal is to minimize wilting by optimizing route sequences and reducing transit time.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) with the retrieval of reusable vases, distance limits (L) to avoid detours exceeding a certain km, time windows (TW) for florists' opening hours, and the ability to interleave deliveries and pickups, which suggests mixed backhaul (MB). There is no mention of vehicles needing to return to the depot, implying open routes (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW'.

Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 74
Description: A veterinary service operates mobile clinics that visit pet owners (<loc_customer>) for scheduled appointments (<time_windows>) while transferring animals between shelters. Vehicles (<capacity>) handle mixed backhauls: delivering medications/supplies (linehaul) and transporting animals (backhaul) in any sequence. Capacity constraints consider both medical inventory and live animal crates, while time windows reflect owner availability and animal stress limits. The objective is to maximize daily appointments while ensuring humane transport conditions.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhauls (MB) where both linehaul (delivering medications/supplies) and backhaul (transporting animals) can be satisfied in any sequence, time windows (TW) for scheduled appointments and animal stress limits, and capacity constraints (C) for both medical inventory and live animal crates. The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'VRPMBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhauls, Time Windows, and Distance Limits. Although distance limits (L) are not explicitly mentioned, the humane transport conditions might imply some form of distance or time constraints for animal welfare, but since it's not clearly stated, we prioritize the explicitly mentioned features.

Description: A specialty photography service uses lightproof vans (capacity <capacity> kg) to distribute unexposed film (<demand_linehaul>) to professional studios (<loc_customer>) while collecting exposed reels (<demand_backhaul>) for processing at the central lab (<loc_depot>). Routes cannot exceed <distance_limit> km to maintain temperature control. The time-sensitive nature requires optimal sequencing of deliveries and pickups without exceeding vehicle capacity.
Reason: The problem description involves backhaul demand (collecting exposed reels) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand (delivering unexposed film) is satisfied ('B'), vehicles have distance limits ('L'), and there is no mention of time windows ('TW') or open routes ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBL'.

Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile clinics (capacity: <capacity> test kits/supplies) from a warehouse (<loc_depot>) to conduct tests at community centers (<loc_customer>) and redistribute surplus PPE to underserved clinics. Testing sites have appointment-based time windows (<time_windows>), and vehicles must return within shift limits (<time_limit>). Routes must efficiently combine testing (linehaul) and supply redistribution (backhaul) without exceeding cargo limits.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul (redistribution of surplus PPE), and linehaul (testing at community centers). The vehicles must return within shift limits, indicating closed routes (not 'O'). The backhaul can only be satisfied after linehaul is completed (not 'MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW', which combines Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows.

Description: A green energy company operates a fleet of mobile electric vehicle charging trucks that must visit parking lots (<loc_customer>) across the city to provide on-demand charging services. Each truck has a battery capacity (<capacity> kWh) and can service multiple locations before needing to recharge at the central depot (<loc_depot>). Parking lots have specific time windows (<time_windows>) when charging is needed (e.g., office lots during work hours, residential areas overnight). The trucks can both deliver charge (linehaul) and collect payment data (backhaul) at each stop in any order. Routes must respect vehicle capacity, maximum shift duration (<duration_limit> hours), and time windows while minimizing total distance traveled.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple features that need to be considered: 1) vehicles have a battery capacity (C), 2) there are time windows for service at parking lots (TW), 3) trucks can both deliver charge (linehaul) and collect payment data (backhaul) in any order (MB), and 4) routes must respect maximum shift duration (L). Given that the vehicles can perform linehaul and backhaul tasks in any order, the 'MB' (mixed backhaul) feature is applicable. Additionally, the presence of time windows and distance (shift duration) limits necessitates the inclusion of 'TW' and 'L' in the variant. The problem does not mention that vehicles do not have to return to the depot, so 'O' (open route) is not applicable. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBLTW'.

Label: CVRP, Predicted: OVRP, Index: 81
Description: A renewable energy company operates offshore wind farms and must deliver maintenance supplies (e.g., lubricants, turbine blades, and electrical components) from a coastal depot to each turbine site. Each wind turbine requires specific parts, and the delivery vessels have limited cargo space. Routes must be planned to service all turbines efficiently, ensuring no vessel exceeds its capacity, while minimizing fuel consumption and operational costs. The challenge includes navigating marine routes and reaching remote offshore locations.
Reason: The problem involves delivering maintenance supplies to offshore wind turbines with limited cargo space (capacity constraint), which aligns with the 'CVRP' (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem). However, the description also mentions navigating marine routes and reaching remote offshore locations, implying that the vehicles (vessels) do not necessarily have to return to the depot after servicing the turbines, which introduces the 'O' (open route) attribute. Additionally, the vessels have limited cargo space (capacity constraint), but no mention is made of backhaul demands, distance limits, or time windows. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRP' (Open Vehicle Routing Problem).

Description: A livestock farm needs to relocate herds between pastures and processing facilities. The central depot is at <loc_depot>, and transfer points are at <loc_customer>. Each vehicle can carry a maximum of <capacity> livestock units due to space and safety regulations. The animals must be transported within a single trip without exceeding a route distance of <distance_limit> kilometers to prevent stress. The total number of livestock at each transfer point is <demand>, and all must be moved while adhering to vehicle capacity and distance limits. Plan routes to ensure all livestock are transported efficiently while minimizing total travel distance.
Reason: The problem description includes vehicle capacity constraints ('C'), distance limits ('L'), and requires all livestock to be transported without any mention of returning to the depot (implying open routes 'O'). There is no mention of backhaul demand ('B') or time windows ('TW'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPL' which accounts for open routes, capacity constraints, and distance limits.

Description: An office solutions provider delivers new desks and chairs to corporate clients while collecting outdated electronics like printers and monitors for recycling. The mixed backhaul approach enables drivers to serve delivery and pickup stops in any order, such as furnishing a startup’s workspace and then collecting e-waste from a neighboring law firm. The vehicle capacity <capacity> must balance the volume of large furniture items with the weight of electronics. Locations <locs> include office buildings and warehouses, with delivery demands <demand_linehaul> and e-waste pickup targets <demand_backhaul>.
Reason: The problem description involves a mixed backhaul approach where both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) can be satisfied simultaneously, and there is no mention of time windows or distance limits. The vehicles do not have to return to the depot, indicating an open route. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRPMB' which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul.

Description: A rental company supplies skis, snowboards, and safety gear to mountain resorts before their seasonal opening. Deliveries must arrive before the resort’s designated opening day (linehaul), and pickups occur after the season closes (backhaul). Trucks face capacity constraints due to equipment size and weight. Resorts enforce strict time windows for setup and teardown, as delays risk losing revenue during peak winter months. The route must prioritize deliveries to remote resorts first to ensure all gear is deployed before the season starts, followed by pickups from easily accessible locations.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, time window constraints (TW) for deliveries and pickups, and there is no mention of vehicles returning to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A retail distributor restocks stores (<demand_linehaul>) and collects defective items (<demand_backhaul>) via trucks (capacity: <capacity>) starting at <loc_depot>. Stores (<loc_customer>) can be visited in any order, but routes must stay under <distance_limit> km to meet daily deadlines. The mixed backhaul approach avoids empty return trips, cutting costs and streamlining inventory management.
Reason: The problem description involves a retail distributor that restocks stores (linehaul) and collects defective items (backhaul) via trucks with a specified capacity. Stores can be visited in any order, but routes must stay under a distance limit. The mention of a mixed backhaul approach (items can be collected while delivering) and the absence of a requirement to return to the depot (implied by the focus on avoiding empty return trips) suggests an open route with mixed backhaul and distance limits. There is no mention of time windows, so 'TW' is not included.

Trucks (capacity <capacity>) start at the nursery (<loc_depot>), alternating deliveries and pickups based on geographic clusters. Routes terminate at composting facilities, avoiding depot returns. The objective is to balance green space expansion with sustainable waste reuse.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (planting saplings) and backhaul (collecting organic waste) demands, with the backhaul being collected after linehaul deliveries are completed. Additionally, the routes are open (terminate at composting facilities without returning to the depot). There is no mention of distance limits or time windows. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRPB' (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls).

Trucks (capacity <capacity>) depart from a nursery (<loc_depot>) and can interleave deliveries/pickups (MB). To meet shift schedules, each route must stay under <distance_limit> km. The goal is to maximize efficiency while adhering to payload and distance constraints.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) where deliveries and pickups can be interleaved, distance limits (L) for each route, and no requirement for vehicles to return to the depot (O). There are no time window constraints mentioned. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBL' which combines open routes (O), mixed backhaul (MB), and distance limits (L).

Vehicles (<capacity>) must handle live animal weight/space limits and prioritize critical cases. Mixed sequences allow emergency pickups between appointments, but time windows are strict to avoid no-shows.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (TW), backhaul demand (B), and linehaul demand (L). Additionally, the backhaul and linehaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously (MB), as indicated by 'Mixed sequences allow emergency pickups between appointments'. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBLTW, which accounts for mixed backhaul, linehaul, distance limits, and time windows.

Maintenance vessels (<capacity>) launch from port (<loc_depot>) to both replenish buoy power cells (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieve data modules (<demand_backhaul>) at waypoints (<loc_customer>). Strict fuel constraints (<distance_limit>) prevent vessels from returning to port, requiring them to dock at coastal stations after final service.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B'), distance limits ('L'), and open routes ('O') where vessels do not return to the depot but instead dock at coastal stations. There is no mention of time windows ('TW') or mixed backhaul ('MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBL'.

Description: A courier company provides time-sensitive document delivery and package returns. Clients require urgent deliveries (e.g., legal contracts) within strict deadlines, while returns must be collected afterward. Each delivery location has a specific time window for service, and pickups can only occur after all deliveries in the route are completed. Vehicles must prioritize deliveries first to meet time constraints, ensuring their cargo capacity isn’t exceeded by the combined weight of outgoing and returned items. Routes conclude at the last return pickup point.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows for service (TW), backhaul demands (B) where pickups can only occur after all deliveries are completed, and the routes conclude at the last return pickup point (O). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes (O), backhaul (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). Although distance limits are not explicitly mentioned, the strict deadlines and cargo capacity constraints imply potential distance or time limits on routes.

Description: Maritime logistics companies must deliver fresh supplies (food, water, and equipment) to cruise ships docked at ports while simultaneously collecting waste and recyclables from the ships. Each cruise ship has a strict docking schedule with a **time window** during which deliveries and pickups must occur. The delivery (linehaul) must precede waste collection (backhaul) to avoid contamination. Vessels have a **capacity limit** for both cargo and waste, and their routes are constrained by a **maximum distance** due to fuel and operational limitations. The challenge is to optimize routes so that all ships receive provisions before their departure time, waste is collected promptly, and no vessel exceeds its capacity or route distance.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there is a time window constraint ('TW') as each cruise ship has a strict docking schedule. Secondly, there is a backhaul demand ('B') where waste collection must occur after deliveries (linehaul). Thirdly, vessels have a distance limit ('L') due to fuel and operational limitations. Additionally, the problem does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, which suggests an open route ('O'). Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes, backhaul demands, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: A marine research team operates remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to deploy scientific instruments at underwater sites (<loc_customer>) and collect mineral samples for analysis. The ROVs are launched from a research vessel at <loc_depot>, with a maximum operational range (<distance_limit> km) due to tether limitations. Each ROV can carry a total payload of <capacity> kg, accommodating both instrument deployment (<demand_linehaul> kg) and sample collection (<demand_backhaul> kg). Deployments must precede retrievals to prevent instrument abandonment, and routes must balance exploration efficiency with battery life constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there is a backhaul demand (sample collection) that can only be satisfied after the linehaul demand (instrument deployment) is fulfilled, which corresponds to 'B'. Second, the ROVs have a maximum operational range due to tether limitations, which corresponds to 'L'. Additionally, the ROVs do not necessarily have to return to the depot after completing their tasks, which corresponds to 'O'. There is no mention of time window constraints ('TW'), so that is not included. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the description is 'OVRPBL'.

Description: A non-profit distributes medical equipment (e.g., diagnostic tools, vaccines) to remote clinics for short-term health campaigns. After the campaign, unused or expired items must be collected. Deliveries must precede pickups to ensure equipment availability. Each vehicle has a capacity limit. Clinics have delivery time windows (aligned with staff schedules) and pickup deadlines after the campaign. The goal is to minimize travel distance while adhering to constraints, with routes terminating at the last pickup site.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there are delivery time windows (TW) for clinics, which must be adhered to. Second, there is a backhaul component (B) where unused or expired items must be collected after deliveries are completed, and deliveries must precede pickups (indicating a backhaul demand that is satisfied only after linehaul demand is met). Third, the routes terminate at the last pickup site, which implies that vehicles do not return to the depot (O). Additionally, each vehicle has a capacity limit (C), but this is ignored when other features are present. Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes (O), backhaul (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).

Each farm supplies a specific daily volume (<demand> liters), and the trucks (<capacity> liters capacity) must first collect milk from farms before delivering it to processing hubs. The challenge is to design routes where the total milk collected from farms plus the milk loaded for delivery does not exceed the truck’s capacity at any point. The goal is to minimize fuel costs while ensuring all farms are serviced and milk is efficiently transported to processing centers without overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem description involves collecting milk from farms (linehaul) and delivering it to a central processing plant (backhaul) with capacity constraints. The key feature here is that the trucks must first collect milk from farms before delivering it to the processing plant, which aligns with the backhaul (B) variant where backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied. There is no mention of distance limits (L), time windows (TW), or open routes (O), so the most appropriate variant is 'VRPB'.

Description: An indoor farming company coordinates daily harvests from rooftop greenhouses while delivering new seed stock. Trucks depart from a distribution center (<loc_depot>) with seed packages (<demand_linehaul>) and collect harvested produce (<demand_backhaul>) from urban farms (<loc_customer>). Each electric vehicle has battery-limited range (<distance_limit>) and weight capacity (<capacity>). Routes may alternate deliveries and pickups based on farm readiness schedules.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering seed packages) and backhaul (collecting harvested produce) demands, which can be satisfied simultaneously based on farm readiness schedules, indicating a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario. Additionally, the vehicles have battery-limited range (distance limits, L) and weight capacity (capacity, C). There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBL, which accounts for mixed backhaul, distance limits, and capacity constraints.

Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 54
Description: A music festival organizer must transport stage equipment, sound systems, and lighting gear between venues across a region. Each venue has a tight time window for setup before performances begin. Trucks are limited by cargo capacity (C) to avoid overloading and must adhere to distance limits (L) to ensure drivers can complete routes within a single shift. Routes must also account for road closures and traffic patterns to meet strict deadlines and prevent logistical bottlenecks.
Reason: The problem description includes several key constraints that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are time window constraints ('TW') as each venue has a tight time window for setup. Secondly, the trucks have distance limits ('L') to ensure drivers can complete routes within a single shift. Additionally, the problem does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, suggesting an open route ('O'). There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, so 'B' and 'MB' are not considered. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the description is 'OVRPLTW', which combines open routes, distance limits, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 77
Description: A sports league operator delivers sports equipment to stadiums before games and collects it post-event. Each venue has strict time windows for setup and teardown. Delivery trucks must first distribute gear (linehaul) to all locations, then return to collect the equipment (backhaul). Capacity constraints limit the number of items per truck, and routes are restricted to a maximum distance to cover multiple venues efficiently. All deliveries must precede game starts, and pickups must align with post-game cleanup schedules.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW). The backhaul demand must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' feature. The vehicles have distance limits (L), and there are strict time windows for setup and teardown (TW). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.

Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 14
Description: A catering company services <num_customer> event venues (<loc_customer>) by delivering fresh food (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieving equipment (<demand_backhaul>) post-event. Vehicles (capacity <C>) from a kitchen hub (<loc_depot>) must sequence tasks flexibly: some venues need early AM deliveries (5:00–7:00 AM) and late PM pickups (10:00 PM–midnight), while others have inverted schedules. Time windows (<time_windows>) are venue-specific, and capacity limits prevent perishable/return item mixing. Routes minimize idle time between delivery and pickup phases.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), time window constraints (TW), and the need to sequence tasks flexibly which implies that both linehaul and backhaul demand can be satisfied simultaneously (MB). The vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot after completing their tasks, indicating open routes (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPMBTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 78
Description: A recycling firm delivers empty bins to businesses and collects filled ones weekly. Each client specifies time windows for deliveries and pickups. Trucks must first distribute empty bins (linehaul) before returning to collect the waste (backhaul). Capacity limits depend on bin sizes, and routes cannot exceed a distance threshold to ensure same-day service. The company must coordinate deliveries and pickups to meet business schedules without overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there are time windows for deliveries and pickups ('TW'). Second, the problem involves backhaul demand ('B') where trucks must first distribute empty bins (linehaul) before collecting filled ones (backhaul). Third, there are distance limits ('L') on routes to ensure same-day service. Additionally, the problem does not mention that vehicles must return to the depot, which could imply open routes ('O'), but this is not explicitly stated. Given the presence of 'B', 'L', and 'TW', the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW', which combines backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 31
Description: A sports league needs to transport goalposts, nets, and safety gear to stadiums (<loc_customer>) for matches (linehaul), then remove the equipment post-event (backhaul). Each venue has specific window times for setup (<time_windows>) to avoid conflicts with other events, and teardown must occur after the match ends. Equipment weight and bulk (<demand>) require careful vehicle capacity management (<capacity>). Drivers finalize their routes at the last venue, eliminating depot returns.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) as equipment needs to be removed post-event, time window constraints (TW) for setup and teardown, and open routes (O) since drivers finalize their routes at the last venue without returning to the depot. The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A green energy company dispatches technician teams to service solar farms (<loc_customer>), delivering replacement parts (linehaul) and retrieving defective panels (backhaul). Each truck has a weight limit (<capacity>) and must complete routes within daylight hours (<time_limit>). Farms have narrow service windows (<time_windows>) due to grid connectivity protocols. Routes must optimize the sequence of deliveries and pickups while adhering to distance constraints (<distance_limit> km) in remote areas.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). Additionally, the routes do not necessarily have to return to the depot, indicating an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 2
Description: A furniture retailer operates a "trade-in" program where customers receive new furniture deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) and simultaneously have old furniture picked up (<demand_backhaul>). Delivery trucks start from the main warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering new items to households, then collecting discarded furniture from other customers. The trucks must never exceed their weight capacity (<capacity>), and pickups can only occur after all deliveries on the route are finalized. The challenge is to balance load distribution and route efficiency to reduce total driving distance while ensuring timely service for both delivery and recycling requests.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, and there is a capacity constraint (C). There is no mention of distance limits (L), time windows (TW), or open routes (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the description is 'VRPB'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 10
Description: A catering service delivers freshly prepared meals to hospital wards while simultaneously collecting biohazard waste (e.g., used medical supplies). Each vehicle (capacity: <capacity>) must adhere to strict time windows (<time_windows>) for meal delivery (linehaul) and waste pickup (backhaul), which can be sequenced flexibly. Routes are constrained by a maximum shift duration (<time_limit>) to comply with labor laws. The depot (<loc_depot>) serves 15 hospital locations (<loc_customer>) with varying demands (<demand_linehaul>, <demand_backhaul>).
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (biohazard waste pickup) which can be sequenced flexibly with linehaul demand (meal delivery), indicating a mixed backhaul scenario ('MB'). It also specifies time windows ('TW') for both linehaul and backhaul, and a maximum shift duration which acts as a time limit. There is no mention of vehicles not returning to the depot, so it is not an open route ('O'). The problem also involves capacity constraints ('C'), but since other features ('MB' and 'TW') are present, 'C' is ignored. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description: A company rents out audio-visual equipment for events. Vehicles (<capacity>) deliver gear to venues (<loc_customer>) and later retrieve it, with strict time windows (<time_windows>) aligned with event schedules. Mixed backhauls allow ad-hoc pickups (e.g., collecting canceled orders en route to deliveries). Distance limits (<distance_limit>) ensure timely equipment transfers between multiple events per day. The goal is to maximize asset utilization while avoiding overtime costs.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhauls ('MB'), distance limits ('L'), and time windows ('TW'). The vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot after deliveries, indicating an open route ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPMBLTW'.

Description: A company needs to transport heavy turbine foundations to offshore wind farm sites. The central port is at <loc_depot>, and installation sites are at <loc_customer>. Each barge can carry a maximum of <capacity> tons. Due to tidal restrictions and fuel capacity, each trip must not exceed <distance_limit> nautical miles. Plan routes to deliver all foundations while adhering to weight and distance constraints.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each barge has a distance limit ('L') due to tidal restrictions and fuel capacity, and there is no mention of the barges needing to return to the depot, which suggests an open route ('O'). There is no mention of backhaul demand or time windows, so 'B' and 'TW' are not applicable. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPL', which combines open routes with distance limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 14
Description: An automotive supplier delivers new parts to repair shops (<loc_customer>) and collects used parts for recycling. Deliveries must precede pickups to ensure shops receive parts before returning old inventory. Delivery trucks have a limited capacity (<capacity>) for both new and used parts. Each shop has a time window (<time_windows>): deliveries are required by morning hours (e.g., 8:30 AM) to support daily operations, while pickups are scheduled in the afternoon (e.g., 3:00 PM) after repairs are completed. The objective is to design routes that meet all time constraints, avoid overloading vehicles, and ensure pickups follow deliveries to streamline inventory management.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there is a capacity constraint (<capacity>), which is a common feature in VRP problems. Second, there is a backhaul demand (B) where used parts are collected after delivering new parts, and this backhaul can only be satisfied after all linehaul (delivery) demands are met. Third, there are time window constraints (<time_windows>) for both deliveries and pickups. Additionally, the problem does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, which suggests an open route (O). Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes, backhaul demands, distance limits (though not explicitly mentioned, often implied in such problems), and time windows.

Description: A national art gallery network ships new exhibits (<demand_linehaul>) to regional galleries (<loc_customer>) from a storage facility (<loc_depot>) while retrieving loaned artworks (<demand_backhaul>). Fragile cargo limits vehicle capacity to <capacity>. Routes must end at the last gallery (open routes), with a <distance_limit> km constraint to minimize vibration damage during transit.
Reason: The problem description includes open routes ('O'), backhaul demand ('B'), and distance limits ('L'). There is no mention of time windows ('TW') or mixed backhaul ('MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all the given constraints is 'OVRPBL'.

Description: A yacht manufacturer must transport newly built luxury yachts from its shipyard (<loc_depot>) to <num_customer> coastal ports (<loc_customer>) for client deliveries. Each port has a time window (<time_windows>) when it can accept the yacht due to tidal restrictions and scheduling, with a service time (<service_time>) for docking and inspection. Transport barges (<capacity>) can carry only one yacht at a time and must adhere to a distance limit (<distance_limit>) to avoid extended voyages. The challenge is to plan routes that align with port schedules while minimizing total travel time and ensuring yachts arrive before clients cancel due to delays.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>) for port deliveries, distance limits (<distance_limit>) for the barges, and does not mention any requirement for the barges to return to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). Additionally, there is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPLTW', which combines open routes (O), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).

Description: During multi-sport events, mobile laundry units visit athlete housing (<loc_customer>) to collect dirty uniforms (<demand_backhaul>) and deliver cleaned ones (<demand_linehaul>). Vehicles (capacity <capacity>) operate within tight time windows (<time_windows>) between training sessions. Routes terminate near competition venues to prepare for next-day logistics.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B') where dirty uniforms are collected after delivering clean ones, time window constraints ('TW') due to tight schedules between training sessions, and the routes terminate near competition venues without mentioning a return to the depot, indicating open routes ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBTW' which combines open routes, backhaul demand, and time windows.

Description: Researchers deploy buoys with sensors (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieve damaged units (<demand_backhaul>) across coastal sites (<loc_customer>) using boats departing from a harbor (<loc_depot>). Each boat has limited cargo space (<capacity>) and must complete its route within <distance_limit> nautical miles due to fuel constraints. Tide-dependent time windows (<time_windows>) dictate when buoys can be installed/removed at each site. Boats remain at their final location for overnight monitoring.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). Additionally, the boats remain at their final location for overnight monitoring, indicating that they do not return to the depot, which implies an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile testing units to conduct COVID-19 tests at designated sites (<loc_customer>). Each unit starts from a central lab (<loc_depot>) with a capacity of <capacity> test kits and must collect swab samples (<demand_backhaul>) while delivering fresh testing supplies (<demand_linehaul>). Routes must be optimized to ensure:  
- Units never exceed their kit/sample capacity.  
- Testing and sample collection can occur in any order (e.g., a unit might pick up samples before delivering more kits).  
- Total travel distance per unit stays under <distance_limit> km to maintain testing schedules.
Reason: The problem description includes mobile testing units that must both deliver testing supplies (linehaul) and collect swab samples (backhaul), and these activities can occur in any order, indicating a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario. Additionally, the vehicles have a distance limit (L), and there is no mention of the need to return to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). There are no time window constraints mentioned, so 'TW' is not included. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBL'.

Description: An auto manufacturer supplies parts to assembly plants (<loc_customer>) with synchronized production schedules (<time_windows>). Trucks (<capacity>) must deliver new components (<demand_linehaul>) while collecting used "core" parts (<demand_backhaul>) for remanufacturing. Mixed sequences are allowed (e.g., deliver to Plant A, pick up from Plant B, then deliver to Plant C). Tight time windows and load balancing are critical to avoid assembly line stoppages.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed sequences of deliveries and pickups (Mixed Backhaul - 'MB'), time windows ('TW'), and does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot (Open route - 'O'). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPMBTW'.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 85
Description: A research organization must deliver specialized equipment (e.g., sensors, lab gear) to remote field sites for environmental studies. Each site has a strict time window for equipment delivery (due to permit restrictions) and a later pickup window after the study concludes. Vehicles must first deliver equipment (linehaul) before collecting unused/used items (backhaul). Each truck has a capacity limit to ensure it doesn’t overload. The goal is to minimize travel distance while respecting time windows and capacity constraints, with routes ending at the final pickup location.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints (TW) for both delivery and pickup, backhaul demand (B) where pickup can only occur after all deliveries are completed, and capacity constraints (C). Although the vehicles do not return to the depot after the final pickup (which suggests an open route (O)), the presence of backhaul and time window constraints are more specific and thus take precedence in classification. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPBTW', which combines backhaul and time window constraints.

Description: A coastal environmental agency uses research vessels to deploy scientific instruments (linehaul) to <num_customer> marine monitoring stations (<loc_customer>) and later collect plastic waste (backhaul) from polluted beaches. Each vessel has a <capacity> ton capacity for equipment and waste. The equipment deployment phase must occur before waste collection to avoid contamination of scientific gear. Vessels must also adhere to a <distance_limit> nautical mile limit to ensure safe return to the base port (<loc_depot>) without refueling. The challenge is optimizing routes to cover all stations and cleanup sites efficiently while balancing cargo weight and avoiding overreach of travel limits.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met, distance limits (L) for the vessels, and the requirement for vessels to return to the base port (not open route). There are no mentions of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPBL'.

Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 34
Description: Event organizers deliver stage equipment (lights, audio systems) to venues (linehaul) before setup deadlines and retrieve it after events (backhaul). Venues enforce strict time windows for equipment access, often aligning with load-in/load-out schedules. Trucks must first deliver gear without overloading, then return later to collect it within the teardown window, balancing capacity for both outbound and inbound loads.
Reason: The problem description involves both linehaul and backhaul demands (B), time window constraints (TW), and does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature. The strict time windows for equipment access correspond to the 'TW' (time window) feature. There is no mention of distance limits (L) or mixed backhaul (MB), so these are not considered. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBTW'.

Description: A river-based distribution network supplies fresh produce to floating markets (<demand_linehaul>) and collects organic waste (<demand_backhaul>) for composting using boats (capacity <capacity>). Starting from a riverside depot (<loc_depot>), routes must serve <num_customer> docks (<loc_customer>) in any order while adhering to a <distance_limit> nautical mile constraint per boat due to fuel efficiency. Boats remain at their final docking point after completing collections.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) where organic waste is collected after delivering fresh produce, distance limits (L) due to fuel efficiency constraints, and open routes (O) since boats remain at their final docking point without returning to the depot. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.

Description: A medical logistics provider must simultaneously deliver urgent supplies (e.g., vaccines, reagents) to clinics and collect lab samples for testing. Each vehicle (capacity <C>) departs from a central lab (<loc_depot>), visits <num_customer> healthcare facilities (<loc_customer>), and handles both deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) and pickups (<demand_backhaul>) in any order. Facilities impose strict time windows (<time_windows>) for sample freshness (e.g., 8:00–10:00 AM) and supply deliveries (e.g., 1:00–3:00 PM). Routes must balance urgent deliveries with time-sensitive pickups while respecting vehicle capacity.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) demands that can be handled in any order (mixed backhaul), strict time windows for both deliveries and pickups, and vehicle capacity constraints. The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'VRPMBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Limited distance, and Time Windows.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 75
Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile testing and vaccination units that must visit multiple locations (<loc_customer>) from a central depot (<loc_depot>). Each vehicle has limited medical supplies (<capacity>) and must complete its route within a strict duration limit (<time_limit>) due to vaccine temperature constraints. Some stops require testing (pickups of samples) while others require vaccine delivery (drop-offs), which can be sequenced flexibly. Each location has specific time windows (<time_windows>) for service based on appointment schedules, and technicians must wait if arriving early. The goal is to maximize served populations while minimizing total distance traveled.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple features that need to be considered: 1) vehicles have limited medical supplies (capacity), 2) there are time window constraints for service (<time_windows>), 3) some stops require testing (pickups) while others require vaccine delivery (drop-offs), which can be sequenced flexibly (mixed backhaul), and 4) vehicles must complete their routes within a strict duration limit (<time_limit>). The presence of mixed backhaul (MB) and time windows (TW) are the most specific features in this context, overriding the basic capacity constraint (C). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPMBTW'.

Description: A touring theater company moves modular stage components between temporary venues (<loc_customer>) with strict load-in/out schedules (<time_windows>). Trucks (capacity <capacity>) simultaneously deliver sets to new locations and retrieve props from previous shows, sequenced by performance dates. Drivers conclude routes at the active venue to assist with setup, eliminating return trips to storage (<loc_depot>).
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul operations (retrieving props from previous shows), and open routes (drivers conclude routes at the active venue without returning to the depot). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows. Although distance limits are not explicitly mentioned, the context implies that drivers must conclude routes at the active venue, which could be interpreted as a form of route length constraint. However, since 'L' is not explicitly stated, the next best fit is 'OVRPBTW', which includes open routes, backhaul, and time windows.

Description: A studio manages daily equipment rentals to shooting locations (linehaul) and retrieves gear from wrap sites (backhaul). Vehicles (<capacity>) follow flexible sequences to accommodate filming schedules (<time_windows>). Routes are capped at <time_limit> hours due to union rules. The equipment depot (<loc_depot>) coordinates with 25 active sets (<loc_customer>), each with unique load/unload times (<service_time>).
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), time windows (TW), and flexible sequences which imply that vehicles do not necessarily return to the depot (O). However, the description does not explicitly state that vehicles do not return to the depot, so we cannot confirm 'O'. It also mentions that routes are capped at a time limit, which can be interpreted as a distance limit (L). The backhaul demand is described as being satisfied after linehaul demand, which aligns with 'B' rather than 'MB'. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the description is 'VRPBLTW', which includes backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: A food truck festival organizer deploys grills, generators, and utensils to temporary stalls (linehaul) before the festival opens, then retrieves them after closing (backhaul). Each stall’s location has time windows for setup (e.g., 6 AM) and teardown (midnight). Trucks must balance capacity constraints due to heavy equipment, prioritizing deliveries to distant locations first. Overloading or late pickups incur fines, as equipment must be cleared by the venue’s deadline. Time windows also depend on local regulations for public space usage.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands (B), time window constraints (TW), and the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot (O). The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' feature. The time windows are explicitly mentioned for setup and teardown, fitting the 'TW' feature. The description does not mention distance limits (L) or mixed backhaul (MB), and the vehicles are not required to return to the depot, hence the 'O' feature is applicable. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBTW'.

Service vehicles (<capacity>) from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>) perform mixed tasks: delivering software updates (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting obsolete hardware (<demand_backhaul>). Routes are open-ended with <distance_limit> constraints to ensure technician shifts end on time. The objective is to synchronize digital updates with hardware refresh cycles efficiently.
Reason: The problem description mentions open-ended routes (O), backhaul demand (B), and distance limits (L). The routes are open-ended (O), which means vehicles do not have to return to the depot. There is backhaul demand (B) for collecting obsolete hardware, and distance limits (L) to ensure technician shifts end on time. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB), so those are not included. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.

Service boats (<capacity>) launch from a riverside depot (<loc_depot>), interleaving supply and harvest tasks as needed. Daily routes cannot exceed <distance_limit> nautical miles due to fuel tank limitations, with boats docking at the last visited farm.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (collection of mature crops) which can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand (delivery of liquid nutrients) is satisfied ('B'), distance limits ('L'), and open routes where boats do not return to the depot ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL' which includes open routes, backhaul demand, and distance limits.

Description: A logistics firm delivers temporary storage containers to construction sites (linehaul) within strict time windows aligning with project timelines. Containers must arrive before the site’s operational start date to avoid delays. Once construction completes, the containers are retrieved (backhaul) during post-project cleanup phases. Each truck adheres to capacity limits (C), ensuring deliveries precede pickups (B). Routes conclude at the last pickup point (O), eliminating depot returns.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there are strict time windows (TW) for deliveries and pickups. Second, there is a backhaul demand (B) where containers must be picked up after all deliveries are completed. Third, the routes conclude at the last pickup point without returning to the depot (O).

Each van (capacity <capacity>) starts at the service center (<loc_depot>) and visits <num_customer> locations (<loc_customer>), where some stops require device drop-offs (<demand_linehaul>) and others need e-waste pickups (<demand_backhaul>). Time windows (<time_windows>) reflect customer availability, and routes cannot exceed <distance_limit> km due to battery constraints. Technicians finish their shifts at their last stop without returning to base.
Reason: The problem description includes open routes (O) where technicians finish their shifts at their last stop without returning to base, backhaul demand (B) for e-waste pickups, distance limits (L) due to battery constraints, and time windows (TW) for customer availability. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 40
Description: A fleet of mobile electric vehicle (EV) charging trucks operates across a metropolitan area, providing on-demand charging services to stranded EVs while simultaneously collecting depleted batteries for recycling. Each truck has a limited battery capacity (<capacity> kWh) and must visit customers (<loc_customer>) within strict time windows (<time_windows>) when drivers are available. The service involves both delivering charge (linehaul) and collecting old batteries (backhaul) in any order, with routes constrained by maximum shift durations (<time_limit> hours).
Reason: The problem involves mobile electric vehicle charging trucks that perform both linehaul (delivering charge) and backhaul (collecting old batteries) tasks in any order, which corresponds to 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Additionally, the problem includes time window constraints ('TW') for customer visits and shift duration limits. There is no mention of the vehicles needing to return to the depot, suggesting 'O' (open route) is applicable. The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'OVRPMBLTW'.

Description: A literary preservation society operates a boat-based service (capacity <capacity> books) supplying remote coastal libraries (<loc_customer>) with new stock (<demand_linehaul>) while retrieving fragile historical texts (<demand_backhaul>) for digitization. Vessels must complete routes within <distance_limit> nautical miles due to tidal constraints. The central archive (<loc_depot>) requires careful load planning to prevent damage during mixed cargo operations.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (retrieving fragile historical texts) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand (supplying new stock) is met, and the vehicles have distance limits (must complete routes within <distance_limit> nautical miles). There is no mention of time windows or open routes, so the most appropriate variant is 'VRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 70
Description: A renewable energy company operates a fleet of mobile cleaning units to maintain solar farms across a region. Each unit starts at a central hub (<loc_depot>) and visits solar panel arrays (<loc_customer>) to perform two tasks: cleaning panels (delivering cleaning service, <demand_linehaul>) and collecting defective panels for recycling (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have a limited capacity (<capacity>) for carrying defective panels and cleaning supplies, and each route cannot exceed <distance_limit> km due to battery constraints. The goal is to optimize routes so that all arrays are serviced without exceeding vehicle capacity or range, and technicians end their shifts at their final location.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (collecting defective panels) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand (cleaning panels) is satisfied (B), vehicles have distance limits (L), and technicians end their shifts at their final location (O). Since the problem includes backhaul, distance limits, and open routes, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.

Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 21
Description: A catering company delivers hot meals to corporate events (<demand_linehaul>) and collects uneaten portions (<demand_backhaul>) for donation or composting. Meals must be delivered within 30 minutes of event start times (<time_windows>), while pickups occur after events conclude. Each vehicle (capacity <capacity> meals) has a 6-hour operating window (<duration_limit>). The goal is to optimize routes so meal deliveries precede pickups, prevent temperature breaches, and ensure timely service without overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B'), time windows ('TW'), and capacity constraints ('C'). However, since 'B' and 'TW' are present, the 'C' is ignored. The backhaul demand must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' feature. Additionally, the time windows for deliveries and pickups are specified, which corresponds to the 'TW' feature. There is no mention of open routes ('O'), distance limits ('L'), or mixed backhaul ('MB'), so these are not considered. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW'.

Description: Ecologists service artificial wetlands across a river delta using boats. Each boat carries tools (<capacity>) from a dock (<loc_depot>) to repair habitats (deliveries) and collect water samples (pickups). Time windows (<time_windows>) align with tidal conditions. Boats finish routes at the last wetland, avoiding backtracking to the dock.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demands (pickups and deliveries), and open routes (boats finish routes at the last wetland, avoiding backtracking to the dock). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 17
Description: A research team deploys ships from port (<loc_depot>) to oceanographic stations (<loc_customer>). Each station requires equipment drop-offs (<demand_linehaul>) and sample collections (<demand_backhaul>). Vessels (<capacity>) dynamically sequence stops (e.g., retrieving samples before deploying new sensors) and conclude routes at the last station for extended fieldwork, minimizing transit time between critical sites.
Reason: The problem description involves deploying ships from a port to oceanographic stations with both equipment drop-offs (linehaul) and sample collections (backhaul), indicating backhaul demand. The vessels dynamically sequence stops and conclude routes at the last station for extended fieldwork, which implies open routes (O). There is no mention of distance limits (L) or time windows (TW). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPB' (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 91
Description: A vertical farm supplies fresh produce to grocery stores (<loc_customer>) using electric trucks (capacity <capacity>) from an urban greenhouse (<loc_depot>). Routes combine deliveries of harvested greens with pickups of expired produce for composting. Stores impose narrow receiving windows (<time_windows>) to align with staff availability. Battery constraints limit each truck to <distance_limit> km. Drivers end shifts at final stops to recharge vehicles overnight near delivery clusters.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that define the specific variant of the VRP. First, there are backhaul demands (expired produce pickups) which can be satisfied after all linehaul demands (fresh produce deliveries) are met, indicating a 'B' feature. Second, the trucks have distance limits due to battery constraints ('L'). Third, the stores impose narrow receiving windows ('TW'). Additionally, the drivers end shifts at final stops and do not return to the depot, indicating an open route ('O'). Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 16
Description: A research supply company delivers specialized lab equipment to remote research facilities and collects hazardous biological or chemical samples for analysis. Each van (capacity <capacity>) departs from the central lab (<loc_depot>), first delivering equipment to remote sites, then collecting samples from those same locations. The backhaul phase must occur only after all deliveries are finalized to avoid contamination or equipment damage. The goal is to minimize travel distance while ensuring sample integrity and adherence to safety protocols.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each van must first deliver equipment (linehaul) and then collect samples (backhaul), with the backhaul phase occurring only after all deliveries are finalized. This matches the 'B' (backhaul demand) feature. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), or open routes ('O'), so these features are not considered. The presence of 'B' makes 'CVRP' irrelevant despite the mention of capacity. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPB'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 74
Description: A farm services company delivers pesticides (linehaul) to rural farms during planting windows (TW) and collects empty containers (backhaul) for recycling. Trucks (C) must handle hazardous materials carefully, adhering to strict capacity limits. Routes are limited by distance (L) to cover remote areas efficiently. Drivers begin at the depot, supply pesticides, then retrieve containers, concluding at the depot for recycling—preventing environmental contamination and reducing travel redundancy.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature. Additionally, the routes are limited by distance (L), and the deliveries must occur during planting windows (TW). The vehicles must return to the depot, so it is not an open route (O is not present). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description: A city renovation project uses flatbed trucks (capacity <capacity>) to simultaneously deliver new park benches (<demand_linehaul>) and collect broken fixtures (<demand_backhaul>) from various locations (<loc_customer>). Starting from the municipal yard (<loc_depot>), crews complete their workday at the final job site. Routes are limited to <distance_limit> km to ensure 8-hour workday compliance.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (OVRP) as crews complete their workday at the final job site and do not return to the depot. It also includes backhaul demand (B) where broken fixtures are collected after delivering new park benches, and distance limits (L) to ensure 8-hour workday compliance. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is OVRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 55
Description: A mobile dental unit provides care at underserved communities (<loc_customer>) starting from a central clinic (<loc_depot>).  
Each visit requires delivering sterilized equipment (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting used tools for reprocessing (<demand_backhaul>).  
Vans with <capacity> limits must optimize routes where deliveries/pickups can occur in any order.  
Routes cannot exceed <distance_limit> km due to daily sterilization deadlines.  
After the final stop, vans park at local hubs rather than returning to base.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) where used tools are collected after delivering sterilized equipment, distance limits (L) as routes cannot exceed a certain distance, and open routes (O) since vans park at local hubs after the final stop instead of returning to the depot. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB), so the most appropriate variant is 'OVRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 8
Description: A catering company delivers event equipment (tables, chairs, décor) to venues (<loc_customer>) before setup deadlines (<time_windows>) and retrieves them post-event. Trucks (<capacity> cubic meters) start at the warehouse (<loc_depot>), must arrive at venues by their specified start times, and cannot exceed capacity for both deliveries and pickups. After unloading, drivers proceed to collect used equipment from the same route, ensuring no returns are scheduled until all setups are complete. Routes end at the last venue to avoid redundant travel.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demands (retrieving equipment post-event which can only be done after all deliveries are complete), and open routes (routes end at the last venue). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW' which combines open routes (O), backhaul (B), distance limits (L, implied by the capacity constraints), and time windows (TW).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description: A fleet of maintenance drones (capacity <capacity>) services offshore solar farms, delivering cleaning fluid to panels (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieving full data loggers (<demand_backhaul>) from monitoring stations. Launching from a coastal base (<loc_depot>), routes must cover <num_customer> floating platforms (<loc_customer>) within <distance_limit> km due to battery limits. Drones land on charging stations at their final platform.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (retrieving full data loggers) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand (delivering cleaning fluid) is satisfied ('B'), distance limits due to battery constraints ('L'), and the drones do not return to the depot but instead land on charging stations at their final platform ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL' which combines open routes, backhaul, and distance limits.

Description: A mobile library visits neighborhoods (<loc_customer>) to drop off reserved books (<demand_linehaul>) and collect donations (<demand_backhaul>). The bookmobile (capacity <capacity>) starts at the main library (<loc_depot>) but remains overnight at its final stop. Stops have 2-hour service windows (<time_windows>) for patron access. Daily routes are limited to <distance_limit> miles due to fuel constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), time windows (TW), and the vehicle does not return to the depot (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A floral wholesaler supplies fresh arrangements (<demand_linehaul>) to wedding venues (<loc_customer>) during strict setup windows (<time_windows>), then returns post-event to:  
- Remove decorations (<demand_backhaul>)  
- Collect reusable materials  
Refrigerated trucks (<capacity>) must carefully sequence deliveries (morning) and pickups (evening) while preventing cross-contamination between fresh and used items, all within tight venue access time slots.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B') where the trucks must return to collect items after delivering, time windows ('TW') for strict setup and pickup times, and capacity constraints ('C') for refrigerated trucks. The backhaul is not mixed ('MB') because pickups can only occur after all deliveries are completed. There is no mention of distance limits ('L') or open routes ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW', which combines backhaul and time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 9
Description: A solar farm operator services remote installations (<loc_customer>) by delivering replacement parts (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting faulty panels (<demand_backhaul>). Trucks (capacity: <capacity>) start at a repair center (<loc_depot>) and end routes at the last site. Distance per route is limited to <distance_limit> km to ensure technicians return before nightfall in off-grid areas.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and open routes (O) where trucks do not return to the depot. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBL'.

Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile testing and vaccination units that must visit multiple locations (<loc_customer>) within strict time windows (<time_windows>) to administer services. Each unit has a limited capacity (<capacity>) for test kits, vaccines, and biohazard waste containers. During visits, the units both deliver supplies (e.g., vaccines) and collect used materials (e.g., swabs, needles) in any order. The challenge is to optimize routes that respect vehicle capacity, time-sensitive service windows, and mixed backhaul operations while minimizing travel distance.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (TW), mixed backhaul operations (MB), and vehicle capacity constraints (C). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'VRPMBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Limited capacity, and Time Windows. The 'O' prefix is not included because there is no mention of open routes (vehicles not returning to the depot).

Description: Municipal composting trucks (<capacity>) visit neighborhood drop-off points (<loc_customer>) to collect organic waste (<demand_backhaul>) and distribute processed fertilizer (<demand_linehaul>). Starting from a processing plant (<loc_depot>), routes must stay under <distance_limit> km due to odor containment requirements. The system optimizes simultaneous waste collection and fertilizer redistribution in a single trip.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (waste collection) and linehaul (fertilizer distribution) demands that can be satisfied simultaneously (mixed backhaul), and the vehicles have distance limits. There is no mention of time windows or open routes, so the most appropriate variant is VRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 4
Description: A contractor coordinates trucks (capacity <capacity>) to deliver supplies (<demand_linehaul>) to construction sites (<loc_customer>) and haul away debris (<demand_backhaul>). Sites enforce time windows (<time_windows>) to avoid disrupting ongoing work. Trucks depart from a storage yard (<loc_depot>) and park near their final site for next-day use. The problem requires optimizing mixed-load routes to minimize idle time between deliveries and pickups while adhering to site access constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>), time windows (<time_windows>), and mixed-load routes (implying mixed backhaul 'MB'). Additionally, the trucks do not return to the depot but park near their final site, indicating an open route ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW', which accounts for open routes, mixed backhaul, distance limits (implied by parking near the final site), and time windows.

Label: VRPBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 74
Description: A volcanic observatory must resupply remote research stations with equipment (<demand_linehaul> kg) while collecting lava samples (<demand_backhaul> kg) for analysis. Helicopters depart from a base camp (<loc_depot>) with a maximum payload capacity (<capacity> kg) and a flight range limit (<distance_limit> km) due to fuel and safety regulations. Deliveries must be completed before sample pickups to ensure researchers have tools before collecting hazardous materials. Routes must also account for unpredictable volcanic activity to minimize detours.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) where deliveries must be completed before sample pickups, distance limits (L) due to flight range constraints, and the routes do not necessarily require returning to the depot (O) as helicopters might not need to return immediately after completing their tasks. The problem does not mention time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB), so those are not included. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 13
Description: A contractor supplies building materials (<demand_linehaul>) to <num_customer> construction sites (<loc_customer>) while collecting demolition debris (<demand_backhaul>) using trucks (capacity <C>). Sites enforce strict delivery/pickup windows (<time_windows>) aligned with work shifts (e.g., 6:00–8:00 AM deliveries, 4:00–6:00 PM debris removal). Routes dynamically interleave deliveries and pickups based on project phases, avoiding capacity overages when hauling heavy materials or bulky waste. The depot (<loc_depot>) optimizes bidirectional flows across the city.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can be satisfied simultaneously with linehaul demand (MB), time window constraints (TW), and capacity constraints (C). Since the problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) and time windows (TW), the most specific variant is 'VRPMBLTW'. The 'L' (distance limits) is not mentioned, so it is not included. The routes are not specified as open (O), so it is not included either.

Description: An urban vertical farm uses refrigerated trucks (capacity <capacity>) to deliver live produce to restaurants (<loc_customer>) and retrieve empty hydroponic cartridges for sterilization. Restaurants specify delivery times (<time_windows>) to align with meal prep schedules, while cartridge collections are flexible but must occur within the same route. The mixed sequence (e.g., deliver to Restaurant X, collect from Restaurant Y, then deliver to Z) must balance perishable cargo space with cartridge volumes (<demand_linehaul>/<demand_backhaul>).
Reason: The problem involves time windows for deliveries (<time_windows>), mixed backhaul operations (deliveries and collections can occur in any sequence), and capacity constraints (<capacity>). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'VRPMBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Limited capacity, and Time Windows.

Description: A farm coordinates trucks to transport harvested crops (`<demand_backhaul>`) from fields (`<loc_customer>`) to packing centers while delivering empty crates (`<demand_linehaul>`) for the next harvest. Trucks (capacity: `<capacity>`) start at the farm depot (`<loc_depot>`). Key constraints:  
- **Time windows** (`<time_windows>`): Crops must be picked up within 2 hours of harvesting to avoid spoilage.  
- **Duration limits** (`<distance_limit>`): Routes cannot exceed 5 hours due to driver regulations.  
- **Open routes**: Trucks stay at packing centers overnight.  
*Goal*: Optimize routes to reduce spoilage and fuel use.
Reason: The problem description includes open routes ('O'), backhaul demand ('B'), distance limits ('L'), and time windows ('TW'). The backhaul demand is specified as delivering empty crates ('<demand_linehaul>') and transporting harvested crops ('<demand_backhaul>'), which must be satisfied in a specific order (linehaul before backhaul), indicating a backhaul ('B') rather than mixed backhaul ('MB') scenario. The routes are open ('O'), meaning trucks do not return to the depot. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A luxury mobile laundry service operates a fleet of vans to deliver fresh linens to hotels (<loc_customer>) and collect soiled laundry for cleaning. Each van has a capacity of <capacity> kg and must complete routes within <time_limit> hours due to shift constraints. Hotels have strict delivery/pickup windows (<time_windows>) for minimal operational disruption. Vans start at the processing plant (<loc_depot>) but may end routes at any location after final service. The mixed nature allows alternating deliveries and pickups based on real-time needs.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that help identify the most specific variant. First, the vans do not need to return to the depot after completing their routes, which corresponds to 'O' (open route). Second, the service involves both deliveries and pickups (backhauls) that can be performed in a mixed sequence, which corresponds to 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Third, there are strict delivery/pickup windows for the hotels, which corresponds to 'TW' (time windows). The capacity constraint is also mentioned, but since other features are present, it is ignored in the classification. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRPMBTW'.

Teams depart from ranger stations (<loc_depot>) with replacement batteries (<demand_linehaul>) and collect failed units (<demand_backhaul>). Strict time windows (<time_windows>) correspond to animal activity patterns. Vehicles (capacity <capacity> kg) have off-road range limits (<distance_limit> km) and remain at final sites for overnight camping.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). Additionally, the vehicles remain at final sites for overnight camping, indicating an open route (O) where vehicles do not return to the depot. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which combines all these features.

Description: Researchers deploy monitoring buoys from a coastal base (<loc_depot>) to marine sites (<loc_customer>). Boats have limited cargo capacity (<capacity>) and fuel range (<distance_limit>). Some stops require deploying equipment (linehaul) while others retrieve damaged units (backhaul), with order flexible based on tidal conditions. Each site has narrow accessible time windows (<time_windows>) dictated by tides, and installations require precise durations (<service_time>). The objective is to complete all deployments/recoveries within tidal cycles while minimizing nautical miles traveled.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there are time window constraints (<time_windows>) dictated by tides, which corresponds to 'TW'. Second, the problem involves both linehaul (deploying equipment) and backhaul (retrieving damaged units) demands, with the order being flexible based on tidal conditions, which suggests 'MB' (mixed backhaul) rather than strict 'B' (backhaul only after linehaul). Third, boats have a limited fuel range (<distance_limit>), which corresponds to 'L'. There is no mention of vehicles needing to return to the depot, which could imply an open route ('O'), but this is not explicitly stated. Given the presence of 'MB', 'L', and 'TW', the most specific variant is 'VRPMBLTW'.

Description: A tech company services edge data centers (<loc_customer>) by delivering charged coolant tanks (linehaul) and retrieving depleted ones (backhaul). Vehicles with <capacity> tank capacity must operate within <time_windows> to avoid server overheating. Each route is capped at <distance_limit> km due to coolant temperature maintenance requirements. Technicians start at the refrigeration plant (<loc_depot>) but may end routes at designated parking zones near high-priority sites.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants: 1) 'backhaul' (B) for retrieving depleted coolant tanks, 2) 'distance limits' (L) for route length due to coolant temperature maintenance, 3) 'time windows' (TW) for operating within specific time frames to avoid server overheating, and 4) 'open routes' (O) as vehicles may end routes at designated parking zones near high-priority sites without returning to the depot. Given these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which combines open routes, backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: A health agency deploys mobile clinics (capacity: `<capacity>`) from a hub (`<loc_depot>`) to administer vaccines (`<demand_linehaul>`) and collect used syringes (`<demand_backhaul>`) at `<num_customer>` neighborhoods (`<loc_customer>`). Challenges:  
- **Time windows** (`<time_windows>`): Clinics operate only during community-approved hours.  
- **Distance limits** (`<distance_limit>`): Clinics must return to the hub before vaccine coolers lose potency.  
- **Mixed sequencing**: A clinic might vaccinate at Stop 1, collect waste at Stop 2, then vaccinate at Stop 3.  
*Goal*: Maximize vaccinations/day while complying with safety constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple constraints and features that align with specific VRP variants. The presence of both linehaul (vaccinations) and backhaul (syringe collection) demands that can be satisfied in mixed sequencing (not strictly after all linehaul demands) points to 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Additionally, there are time windows ('TW') for clinic operations and distance limits ('L') for the vehicles to return before vaccine coolers lose potency. The vehicles must return to the hub, so it is not an open route ('O' is not applicable). Therefore, the most specific variant that captures all these features is 'VRPMBLTW'.

Description: A construction firm requires timely material delivery (linehaul) to active sites and waste pickup (backhaul) post-work hours. Each site has strict access times (TW) for deliveries and pickups. Trucks (C) must carry heavy loads without exceeding weight limits. Routes are restricted by daily distance limits (L) to prevent driver fatigue. Starting from the depot, crews first supply materials, then collect debris, ending at the depot for waste disposal—ensuring compliance with site schedules and safety protocols.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW). Additionally, the trucks must return to the depot, so it is not an open route (O is not present). The backhaul demand must be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, so it is not mixed backhaul (MB is not present). Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.

Description: A drone rental service delivers survey drones to construction sites for topographic mapping and retrieves them afterward. Each site has a delivery window before survey operations begin and a pickup window after completion. Delivery trucks must first transport drones (linehaul) to all locations, then return to collect them (backhaul). Capacity limits restrict the number of drones per truck, and routes are constrained by distance to cover regional projects efficiently. All deliveries must arrive before survey starts, and pickups must occur after project deadlines.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are delivery and pickup time windows ('TW') that must be adhered to (deliveries before survey starts, pickups after project deadlines). Secondly, there is a backhaul demand ('B') where drones must be picked up after deliveries are completed. Thirdly, the trucks have capacity limits ('C'), but since 'B' and 'TW' are present, 'C' is ignored as per the given rules. Additionally, the routes are constrained by distance ('L'), meaning vehicles have distance limits. There is no mention of mixed backhaul ('MB') or open routes ('O'), so these are not considered. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.

Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 81
Description: A civil engineering firm must deploy teams to install floodgates in vulnerable areas before predicted storm surges (<time_windows>). Each site requires specific materials (<demand>), and vehicles (<capacity> ton capacity) must start from a central depot (<loc_depot>). Due to limited fuel and road accessibility, routes must not exceed <distance_limit> km. Teams must arrive at each location within critical timeframes to prevent catastrophic flooding.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), distance limits (<distance_limit> km), and specific materials demand (<demand>), but does not mention backhaul or mixed backhaul demands. The vehicles must start from a central depot, implying they may or may not return (not explicitly stated as open route). The most specific variant that matches these constraints is 'VRPLTW', which includes both distance limits (L) and time windows (TW).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 20
Description: A logistics provider supplies modular stages and equipment to venues hosting temporary events. The company must deliver infrastructure (linehaul) to each site before the event’s start time (time window), ensuring setup is complete by the scheduled opening. After the event concludes, they collect the equipment (backhaul) during designated retrieval windows. Trucks have limited capacity (C), and routes must prioritize deliveries before pickups (B). Vehicles finish at the final pickup location (O), avoiding return trips to the depot.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are time window constraints (TW) for both deliveries and pickups. Secondly, the problem involves backhaul demands (B) that must be satisfied only after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, the vehicles do not return to the depot (O), making it an open route. Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes (O), backhaul demands (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). Although distance limits (L) are not explicitly mentioned in the description, they are often implied in logistics problems to ensure feasible routes.

Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 48
Description: A florist must deliver custom bouquets to venues during peak wedding season. Each bouquet has a strict delivery window (<time_windows>) to arrive just before ceremonies. Delivery trucks have limited space (<capacity>) for floral arrangements, and routes must be planned to avoid overheating perishable flowers. Distance limits (<distance_limit>) ensure blooms stay fresh overnight without requiring refrigeration stops. The aim is to minimize delays and floral spoilage while meeting all time and capacity constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), capacity constraints (<capacity>), and distance limits (<distance_limit>). The presence of time windows and distance limits suggests the need for 'TW' and 'L' in the variant. Additionally, the problem does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, which implies an open route ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these constraints is 'OVRPLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 67
Description: A food truck network requires fresh cooking equipment and supplies (linehaul) to be delivered to bustling city locations, while simultaneously collecting used cooking oil and waste materials (backhaul). Each delivery truck can carry up to <capacity> kg, and routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius of the central kitchen to ensure timely returns. The solution must balance load distribution and route efficiency to minimize fuel costs and environmental impact.
Reason: The problem description involves both linehaul (delivering fresh cooking equipment and supplies) and backhaul (collecting used cooking oil and waste materials) demands, which can be satisfied simultaneously (mixed backhaul). Additionally, there is a distance limit constraint (routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius of the central kitchen). There is no mention of time windows or open routes, so 'TW' and 'O' are not applicable. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBL' which includes mixed backhaul and distance limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 76
Description: A municipal department manages city parks by delivering new benches, trash bins, and playground equipment (linehaul) while collecting damaged or weathered items (backhaul). Each park’s maintenance crew is only available during specific hours (<time_windows>), necessitating precise timing. Trucks must prioritize deliveries before pickups to avoid blocking access paths, with their total load (new furniture + scrap) never exceeding capacity (<capacity>). Routes conclude at the last serviced park, eliminating return trips to the central depot.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, time window constraints (TW) for park maintenance crews, and open routes (O) where trucks do not return to the central depot. The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Load, and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 65
Description: A marine research institute operates a vessel that must deploy scientific equipment to coastal monitoring stations (linehaul) and collect water/soil samples from these sites (backhaul). Each station has strict time windows for access due to tidal patterns or seasonal conditions. The vessel’s daily travel distance is limited by fuel capacity (<distance_limit> nautical miles), and its onboard storage (<capacity> cubic meters) must accommodate both equipment and samples. Deliveries to stations must precede sample pickups to ensure equipment is deployed before collection.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are strict time windows for access to stations due to tidal patterns or seasonal conditions, which corresponds to 'TW'. Secondly, the vessel has a limited daily travel distance due to fuel capacity, which corresponds to 'L'. Thirdly, there is a requirement for deliveries (linehaul) to precede pickups (backhaul), which corresponds to 'B'. Additionally, the vessel does not necessarily have to return to the depot after completing its tasks, which corresponds to 'O'. Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes, backhaul demands, distance limits, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 32
Description: An energy provider services outdoor festivals by delivering generators (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting depleted fuel tanks (<demand_backhaul>) to/from venues (<loc_customer>). Trucks (capacity <capacity>) depart from a central yard (<loc_depot>) with strict <distance_limit> constraints to ensure same-day returns. Setup/teardown time windows (<time_windows>) vary by venue. Crews end routes at the last venue to assist with equipment installation.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). Additionally, the crews end routes at the last venue, indicating open routes (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 83
Description: A support vessel must deliver ice and supplies (<demand_linehaul>) to <num_customer> fishing boats (<loc_customer>) at sea while collecting their catches (<demand_backhaul>) for transport to port (<loc_depot>). With vessel capacity <capacity> and maximum operational range <distance_limit> nautical miles, routes must strategically sequence deliveries and collections based on real-time boat locations and catch volumes, prioritizing perishable goods.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B') where the vessel collects catches from fishing boats after delivering supplies, and the vessels have a maximum operational range ('L'). There is no mention of time windows ('TW') or open routes ('O'), and the backhaul is not described as mixed ('MB'). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPBL', which combines backhaul and distance limit constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 62
Description: A food truck operator hosts seasonal street festivals, requiring temporary kitchens, grills, and utensils to be delivered (linehaul) to event locations before setup deadlines (TW). After the festival, all equipment must be retrieved (backhaul) by a specified time to avoid storage fees. Vehicles have limited capacity for transporting bulky items, and routes must account for festival-specific time windows, traffic patterns, and the need to service multiple events simultaneously.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demands (B), time windows (TW), and the need to service multiple events simultaneously, which implies mixed backhaul (MB) where both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied in the same route. The vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot, but the description does not explicitly state that they do not, so we assume they do (not 'O'). There is no mention of distance limits (L). Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBTW, which includes mixed backhaul and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 43
Description: A tool rental service supplies construction sites with heavy machinery, power tools, and safety equipment (linehaul) for short-term projects. After use, the tools are retrieved (backhaul) for redistribution. Each site has time windows based on crew availability and shift schedules. Vehicles must first deliver all equipment, then backtrack to collect items, ensuring their capacity (<capacity>) isn’t exceeded. The routes must conclude at the final pickup point to minimize idle driving time and fuel costs.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met, time window constraints (TW) based on crew availability and shift schedules, and capacity constraints (C). The vehicles do not need to return to the depot after the final pickup, indicating an open route (O). However, the most specific variant that captures all these features is 'VRPBTW' (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows), as the open route aspect is not explicitly mentioned as a requirement, and 'VRPBTW' is the most comprehensive variant listed that matches the described constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 0
Description: A municipal waste management team operates trucks (capacity: `<capacity>`) from a central depot (`<loc_depot>`) to collect mixed waste (trash `<demand_linehaul>`) and recyclables (`<demand_backhaul>`) from `<num_customer>` bins (`<loc_customer>`). Trucks can alternate pickups (e.g., trash first, then recyclables, or vice versa) but must not exceed weight limits. Routes are constrained by a max distance `<distance_limit>` (to ensure shifts end on time). After the final stop, trucks proceed directly to a processing plant (no return to depot).
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (recyclables) which can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand (trash) is satisfied (B), distance limits (L), and open routes where trucks do not return to the depot (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL' which combines open routes, backhaul, and distance limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 26
Description: Autonomous waste-collection boats service trash accumulation points along city waterways. Starting from a dock (<loc_depot>), each boat (capacity <capacity> kg) both empties trash bins (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieves floating debris (<demand_backhaul>) in any sequence. Narrow operating windows (<time_windows>) avoid peak boat traffic. Routes are constrained by battery life (<distance_limit> km), with boats docking at maintenance hubs after final stops.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhaul (MB) as boats can both empty trash bins (linehaul) and retrieve floating debris (backhaul) in any sequence, distance limits (L) due to battery life constraints, and time windows (TW) for narrow operating windows. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 7
Description: A furniture retailer partners with an appliance recycling program to deliver new sofas and appliances (linehaul) to customers’ homes while simultaneously collecting old furniture and electronics (backhaul). Delivery trucks have a <capacity> kg limit to balance the weight of outgoing items (e.g., heavy sofas) and incoming recyclables (e.g., TVs, mattresses). Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km range to avoid long detours, and drivers conclude their routes at the final customer address. The company seeks cost-effective delivery paths that maximize recycling pickup without overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands that can be satisfied simultaneously (MB), vehicles have distance limits (L), and the routes are open (O) as drivers conclude their routes at the final customer address. There is no mention of time window constraints (TW), so they are not considered. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBL'.

Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 31
Description: A mobile veterinary service visits neighborhoods to administer pet vaccinations (linehaul) and collect blood samples for lab testing (backhaul). Each clinic van (<capacity> for supplies/samples) must serve appointments within strict time windows (<time_windows>) to align with pet owners’ availability. Routes are constrained by a maximum daily operating duration (<time_limit> hours) to ensure staff welfare. The mixed backhaul requirement allows sample pickups to occur before or after deliveries.
Reason: The problem involves a mobile veterinary service with capacity constraints (<capacity>), mixed backhaul requirements (linehaul and backhaul can occur in any order), strict time windows (<time_windows>), and a maximum daily operating duration (<time_limit> hours). The presence of mixed backhaul (MB), time windows (TW), and capacity constraints (C) suggests the most specific variant is 'VRPMBTW'. The routes are not specified as open (O), and the distance limit (L) is not mentioned, so these are not included in the variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 99
Description: A coastal logistics company manages daily redistribution of goods between floating markets (<loc_customer>) using boats that depart from a central hub (<loc_depot>). Each vessel has limited cargo space (<capacity>) and must serve markets during specific tidal windows (<time_windows>) when docks are accessible. Operations involve both delivering fresh produce (linehaul) and collecting unsold items (backhaul) in any order. Routes cannot exceed 50 nautical miles (<distance_limit>) due to fuel constraints. The solution must optimize this mixed-load routing while accommodating tidal schedules and capacity limits.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) where both linehaul and backhaul can be satisfied simultaneously, distance limits (L) due to fuel constraints, and time windows (TW) for tidal schedules. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBLTW, which includes all these features.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 59
Description: Marine archaeologists require specialized equipment (diving gear, sonar arrays) to be delivered to underwater excavation sites and must later retrieve recovered artifacts. Submersible support vessels (<capacity> m³) have a strict distance limit (<distance_limit>) due to limited battery life. Deliveries must occur first, followed by artifact pickups, with time windows (<time_window>) dictated by safe diving conditions during low tide. Expeditions must conclude before tidal shifts complicate retrieval operations.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there is a backhaul demand (B) where deliveries must occur before artifact pickups, which is a clear backhaul scenario. Second, the submersible support vessels have a strict distance limit (L) due to battery life constraints. Third, there are time windows (TW) dictated by safe diving conditions during low tide. Additionally, the problem does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, which suggests an open route (O). Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes, backhaul demands, distance limits, and time windows.

Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 84
Description: A chemical company services <num_customer> industrial clients (<loc_customer>) from a secure depot (<loc_depot>). Specialized trucks (capacity <capacity>) deliver fresh chemicals (<demand_linehaul>) and collect spent materials (<demand_backhaul>) for disposal, with strict sequencing flexibility to accommodate urgent client needs. Routes are capped at <distance_limit> km due to hazardous material transportation regulations, requiring careful load balancing between inbound and outbound hazardous materials.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B') which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, distance limits ('L') for the routes, and does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, suggesting an open route ('O'). There is no mention of time window constraints ('TW'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 24
Description: A climate control business deploys new HVAC units (linehaul) to commercial buildings during morning installation windows (TW). Outdated equipment is then collected (backhaul) during afternoon retrieval slots. Vehicles must prioritize deliveries before pickups (B), stay within weight limits (C), and terminate routes at the final backhaul stop (O). This ensures timely service without overburdening technicians or vehicles.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demands (B) that must be satisfied after all linehaul demands, time windows (TW) for installation and retrieval slots, and specifies that routes terminate at the final backhaul stop (O), indicating an open route. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A movie studio coordinates equipment rentals for multiple shooting locations (<loc_customer>). Trucks depart from a rental warehouse (<loc_depot>) with mixed loads: delivering cameras/lighting (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting used props (<demand_backhaul>). Each location has narrow time windows (<time_windows>) aligned with shooting schedules. Vehicles have weight limits (<capacity>) and maximum daily operating hours (<time_limit>). Crews keep trucks overnight at the last location to avoid empty return trips.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B'), time windows ('TW'), and open routes ('O') since trucks do not return to the depot overnight. The backhaul demand is mixed ('MB') because both linehaul and backhaul demand can be satisfied simultaneously (delivering and collecting at the same locations). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBTW', which combines open routes, mixed backhaul, and time windows.

Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 69
Description: Cargo spacecraft (<capacity>) departing from <loc_depot> must deliver experiments (<demand_linehaul>) to orbital labs (<loc_customer>) during precise docking windows (<time_windows>), while retrieving completed samples (<demand_backhaul>). Strict weight limits and microgravity constraints require optimal mixed sequencing of transfers.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B'), time windows ('TW'), and implies the possibility of mixed sequencing of transfers (suggesting 'MB' for mixed backhaul). The spacecraft do not necessarily have to return to the depot, which suggests an open route ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPMBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 11
Description: A commercial laundry service supplies fresh linens to hotels and restaurants while collecting used ones for cleaning. Vehicles with capacity `<capacity>` start at the facility `<loc_depot>` and visit `<num_customer>` clients (`<loc_customer>`). Each client has a demand for clean linens (`<demand_linehaul>`) and/or soiled linens to return (`<demand_backhaul>`). Routes must optimize the sequence of drop-offs and pickups to minimize travel distance, with drivers finishing at their final stop.
Reason: The problem description involves vehicles with capacity constraints ('C'), backhaul demand ('B') where soiled linens are collected after delivering clean linens, and the routes do not require returning to the depot ('O'). The most specific variant that matches these features is 'OVRPB', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls. This variant accounts for the open routes (drivers finishing at their final stop) and the backhaul demands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 71
Description: A grocery chain operates in a city, delivering fresh produce to stores (linehaul) and collecting food waste for composting (backhaul). Deliveries must occur before stores open (TW), while pickups happen after closing hours (TW). Trucks (C) are limited in size to fit city streets, and routes must not exceed municipal distance limits (L) to reduce emissions. Drivers begin at the central depot, deliver produce, then collect waste, concluding at the depot for processing—without redundant returns to reduce fuel use.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). Additionally, the vehicles must return to the depot, so it is not an open route (O). The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which is characteristic of a standard backhaul (B) rather than mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 42
Description: A nonprofit coordinates vans (capacity <capacity>) to transfer rescue animals from shelters (<demand_backhaul>) to foster homes (<demand_linehaul>). Shelters impose strict outbound time windows (<time_windows>) for animal welfare, while fosters have limited availability windows. Routes must interleave pickups and drop-offs (e.g., collecting cats from Shelter A before delivering dogs to Foster B) while ensuring vehicle capacity isn’t exceeded by combined crates and supplies.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (from shelters) and linehaul demand (to foster homes), which can be satisfied simultaneously (mixed backhaul), time window constraints for both pickups and drop-offs, and vehicle capacity constraints. The most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPMBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 2
Description: A cooperative uses refrigerated trucks (capacity <capacity>) to deliver fresh produce from a central farm (<loc_depot>) to restaurants (<loc_customer>) demanding <demand_linehaul>. En route, trucks collect unsold surplus (<demand_backhaul>) from earlier deliveries for composting. Restaurants impose strict morning delivery windows (<time_windows>) to align with kitchen prep schedules. Routes are open-ended, allowing trucks to park near final stops. The challenge is to balance delivery urgency with surplus collection efficiency.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that help identify the most specific variant. First, the routes are open-ended ('O'), meaning trucks do not need to return to the depot. Second, there is backhaul demand ('B') where trucks collect unsold surplus after delivering fresh produce. Third, there are time window constraints ('TW') imposed by restaurants for deliveries. These features collectively point to the 'OVRPBTW' variant, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows. The 'O' accounts for the open routes, 'B' for the backhaul demand, and 'TW' for the time windows. The problem does not mention mixed backhaul ('MB') or distance limits ('L'), so those variants are not considered.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 82
Description: A semiconductor manufacturer relies on just-in-time delivery of fragile components (<demand>) to multiple fabrication plants (<loc_customer>). Delivery trucks (<capacity> kg capacity) must depart from a logistics hub (<loc_depot>), adhering to stringent time windows (<time_windows>) to avoid production halts. Routes must also respect <distance_limit> km limits to prevent overheating of climate-controlled cargo compartments.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple fabrication plants (loc_customer), delivery trucks with capacity constraints (capacity), time windows (time_windows), and distance limits (distance_limit). The presence of time windows and distance limits suggests the need for 'TW' and 'L' in the variant. There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, nor is there any indication that the vehicles do not return to the depot (open route). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the description is 'VRPLTW', which includes capacity, distance limits, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 68
Description: A safety equipment provider supplies hardhats, harnesses, and tools to construction sites, then retrieves used gear for sterilization. Vehicles (<capacity> kg) must deliver equipment before <time_window> start times to avoid delays in site operations. After crews finish shifts, trucks return to the same sites to collect gear, ensuring no pickups occur until all deliveries are complete. The <service_time> includes safety inspections at each site, requiring precise scheduling to meet strict occupational health deadlines.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) where pickups can only occur after all deliveries are complete, and time window constraints (TW) for deliveries before site start times. There is no mention of distance limits (L) or open routes (O), and the backhaul is not mixed (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 89
Description: A theatrical equipment network supports rotating productions by managing prop inventories. Transport vans (capacity <capacity>) originate at the central warehouse (<loc_depot>) to deliver period-specific props (<demand_linehaul>) to some theaters (<loc_customer>), while retrieving unused items (<demand_backhaul>) from others in dynamically ordered routes. The system prioritizes efficient space utilization in vehicles, with drivers ending shifts after their last theater visit.
Reason: The problem description involves backhaul demand (retrieving unused items) which can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand (delivering period-specific props) is satisfied, indicating a 'B' feature. Additionally, the drivers end their shifts after their last theater visit, implying that vehicles do not have to return to the depot, which is an 'O' feature. There is no mention of distance limits ('L') or time window constraints ('TW'). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRPB'.

Description: A marketing firm rotates digital billboard displays (<loc_customer>) across city locations using trucks with <capacity> display panels. Each site has specific installation time slots (<time_windows>) to avoid peak traffic. Routes must finish within <time_limit> hours due to daylight constraints. Trucks depart from the warehouse (<loc_depot>) but remain at their final location for overnight security. Mixed operations allow simultaneous removal of old ads (backhaul) and installation of new ones (linehaul) at each stop.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhaul operations (MB), time windows (TW), and open routes (O) since trucks do not return to the depot but remain at their final location. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPMBTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: CVRP, Predicted: OVRP, Index: 61
Description: An energy logistics firm supplies offshore oil drilling platforms with equipment, tools, and maintenance parts. Starting from a coastal depot <loc_depot>, supply vessels must distribute critical cargo to <num_customer> rigs located in distant oceanic regions. Each vessel has a <capacity> ton payload limit, forcing planners to balance load distribution across routes. The challenge lies in ensuring all rigs receive their required supplies (<demand>) without exceeding vessel capacities.
Reason: The problem description mentions that supply vessels must distribute cargo to rigs without any mention of returning to the depot, which suggests an open route (O). Additionally, there is a capacity constraint (C) on the vessels. There is no mention of backhaul (B), distance limits (L), or time windows (TW). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRP' (Open Vehicle Routing Problem).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 35
Description: A feed supplier must deliver fresh livestock feed to farms and collect manure waste for composting. Each farm has a strict delivery time window (e.g., before morning feeding) and a later pickup window for waste collection. Vehicles must first complete all feed deliveries (linehaul) before returning to collect manure (backhaul). Trucks are limited by their capacity to carry both feed and manure without exceeding weight limits. Routes end at the final pickup location, avoiding unnecessary return trips to the depot.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there are strict delivery and pickup time windows (TW) for each farm. Second, the vehicles must complete all feed deliveries (linehaul) before collecting manure (backhaul, B). Third, the routes end at the final pickup location, indicating an open route (O) where vehicles do not return to the depot. Additionally, there is a capacity constraint (C) for carrying both feed and manure, but this is secondary to the other features. The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes, backhaul, distance limits (implied by capacity constraints), and time windows.

Description: A wind farm operator sends service vessels to deliver repair tools and replacement parts (linehaul) to turbines (TW) during weather-permitted windows. After maintenance, vessels collect废旧 turbine components (backhaul) for recycling. Each vessel (C) must complete deliveries before pickups, operate within a maximum travel distance (L) due to fuel constraints, and end routes at the nearest port (O).
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul (B) where vessels collect废旧 turbine components after delivering repair tools and replacement parts, a distance limit (L) due to fuel constraints, and open routes (O) where vessels end at the nearest port instead of returning to the depot. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.

Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 86
Description: A chemical company services automotive factories (<loc_customer>) from its plant (<loc_depot>) using tanker trucks (capacity <capacity>). Each stop requires either delivering fresh paint (<demand_linehaul>) or collecting hazardous waste containers (<demand_backhaul>). Routes are open-ended with technicians staying overnight at their last location, and each truck's route is capped at <distance_limit> km due to hazardous material transport regulations.
Reason: The problem description mentions open-ended routes (O), backhaul demand (B), and distance limits (L). There is no mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the description is 'OVRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 41
Description: A commercial kitchen supplier delivers new equipment to restaurants while simultaneously collecting used cooking oil from clients for recycling. Each truck’s route must alternate between linehaul stops (equipment deliveries) and backhaul stops (oil pickups), adhering strictly to the vehicle’s capacity limit :math:`Q`. The order of visits is flexible, but total load must stay within :math:`Q`. With 20 client locations (<locs>), the goal is to minimize travel costs while ensuring all delivery and pickup demands (<demand_linehaul> and <demand_backhaul>) are met without exceeding capacity.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (equipment deliveries) and backhaul (oil pickups) demands, with the requirement that the order of visits must alternate between these two types of stops. This matches the 'VRPB' (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls) variant, where backhaul demands can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there is a capacity constraint (Q) that must be adhered to, which is a common feature in VRP problems. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), or open routes ('O'), so these features are not considered in the classification.

Description: A telecom provider upgrades rural internet infrastructure by deploying 5G equipment (linehaul) and collecting outdated antennas (backhaul). Sites require installation during maintenance windows (time windows) to avoid service disruptions. Technicians have an 8-hour working shift (duration limit), and trucks must prioritize deliveries before pickups to prevent blocking access to tower sites. Capacity constraints demand careful scheduling to avoid overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are time window constraints ('TW') as installations must occur during maintenance windows. Secondly, there is a backhaul demand ('B') where outdated antennas are collected after delivering new equipment, with a prioritization of deliveries before pickups. Additionally, the problem mentions capacity constraints ('C') and working shifts (which could imply distance or duration limits, but 'L' is not explicitly mentioned). The most specific variant that captures both backhaul and time window constraints is 'VRPBTW'. The capacity constraints are secondary when other features like 'B' and 'TW' are present, and there is no mention of open routes ('O') or mixed backhaul ('MB').

Description: A chain of restaurants requires fresh ingredients delivered before their morning prep (<demand_linehaul>) and empty dishware collected afterward (<demand_backhaul>). Trucks depart from a central commissary (<loc_depot>), must arrive at each restaurant within their designated service hours (<time_windows>), and cannot exceed capacity limits for both deliveries and pickups. The route design must ensure ingredients are dropped off first, followed by dish collection, with drivers concluding their day at the last stop.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>) which must be satisfied after linehaul demand (<demand_linehaul>), and the route does not require returning to the depot (drivers conclude their day at the last stop). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which combines open routes (O), backhaul (B), distance limits (L, implied by not returning to the depot), and time windows (TW).

Description: An event organizer rents stages, sound systems, and lighting equipment for temporary outdoor concerts. After the events, they must retrieve the gear for future use. Routes must balance deliveries and pickups in any sequence, avoiding capacity overloads. The depot and 20 event venues are at <locs>, with setup demands <demand_linehaul> and retrieval demands <demand_backhaul>.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) demands, which must be balanced in any sequence without overloading the vehicle capacity. This matches the 'VRPB' (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls) variant, where backhaul demands can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), or open routes ('O'), so these features are not considered.

Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 78
Description: A luxury wine auction house must deliver fragile, high-value vintage bottles from a storage facility (<loc_depot>) to international auction venues (<loc_customer>). Each venue has a strict unloading time window (<time_windows>) to match auction setup schedules. Refrigerated trucks have a limited capacity (<capacity> bottles) to prevent overcrowding, and routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km range to avoid overheating the cargo. The challenge is to prioritize deliveries without exceeding vehicle limits or missing deadlines for prestigious events.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), distance limits (<distance_limit>), and capacity constraints (<capacity>). The presence of time windows and distance limits suggests the need for 'TW' and 'L' in the variant. Additionally, the problem does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, which implies an open route ('O'). There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, so 'B' or 'MB' are not relevant here. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the description is 'OVRPLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 27
Description: A rotating pop-up shop network requires daily inventory redistribution. Vans (capacity <capacity> units) depart from a warehouse (<loc_depot>) to deliver new stock (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieve unsold items (<demand_backhaul>) from temporary locations (<loc_customer>). Tight time windows (<time_windows>) align with mall access hours. Drivers end routes at assigned overnight parking to avoid empty returns, respecting shift duration limits (<time_limit> hours).
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B'), time windows ('TW'), and the fact that drivers end routes at assigned overnight parking (indicating open routes 'O'). The backhaul demand is retrieved after delivering new stock, which suggests it's not mixed backhaul. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBTW' which combines open routes, backhaul demand, and time windows.

Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 70
Description: A disaster response team uses trucks with a <capacity> ton capacity to deliver sandbags and equipment to flood-prone locations (<loc_customer>). Each site has a setup time window <time_windows> for deliveries (linehaul) and a later window for pickups (backhaul). Vehicles must complete all deliveries before initiating pickups, ensuring compliance with each location's schedule while adhering to truck capacity limits.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (TW) for deliveries and pickups, backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is completed, and capacity constraints (C). However, since 'B' and 'TW' are present, 'C' is ignored. The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'VRPBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, and Time Windows.

Label: VRPMB, Predicted: OVRPMB, Index: 17
Description: A clothing retailer must restock stores with new inventory while collecting returned items for redistribution or recycling. Trucks must carry a mix of new garments (deliveries) and returned clothing (pickups), ensuring total weight stays within capacity <capacity>. The order of stops can be optimized freely to minimize route length. The distribution center and 20 store locations are at <locs>, with delivery demands <demand_linehaul> and return pickups <demand_backhaul>. The focus is on balancing load efficiency and cost reduction while meeting customer service requirements.
Reason: The problem involves both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) demands, which can be satisfied simultaneously (mixed backhaul). There is no mention of time windows or distance limits, and the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot (open route is implied by the focus on minimizing route length without specifying a return). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRPMB' (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 65
Description: A high-end art rental company delivers valuable sculptures and paintings to corporate event venues for temporary exhibitions. Each venue has a strict time window for delivery to align with event schedules. After the event concludes, the art must be securely retrieved within specified windows to avoid delays in other bookings. Delivery vehicles have limited capacity and must complete all deliveries (linehaul) before starting pickups (backhaul). The challenge is to plan routes that respect time constraints, ensure capacity limits, and minimize travel distance while adhering to the delivery-first sequence.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints ('TW') for deliveries and pickups, backhaul demand ('B') which must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is completed, and there is no mention of vehicles returning to the depot, implying open routes ('O'). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes, backhaul, distance limits (though not explicitly mentioned, it's implied by the need to minimize travel distance), and time windows.

Description: A company operates mobile electric vehicle (EV) charging stations that must visit urban locations (<loc_customer>) to deploy charged batteries (<demand_linehaul>) and collect depleted ones (<demand_backhaul>). Each service vehicle (capacity <capacity>) starts at a depot (<loc_depot>) and can sequence deliveries and pickups freely (MB). Due to battery constraints, each vehicle’s route cannot exceed <distance_limit> km. The goal is to ensure all locations receive fresh batteries while minimizing total travel distance, avoiding overloading, and adhering to range limits.
Reason: The problem description includes mobile electric vehicle charging stations that must visit urban locations to deploy charged batteries (linehaul) and collect depleted ones (backhaul), with the ability to sequence deliveries and pickups freely (MB). Each vehicle has a capacity constraint (<capacity>) and a distance limit (<distance_limit> km). The vehicles start at a depot but the description does not explicitly require them to return to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). There are no time window constraints mentioned. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBL', which includes open routes (O), mixed backhaul (MB), and distance limits (L).

Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 78
Description: A fashion brand circulates seasonal samples to high-end boutiques (<loc_customer>), delivering new collections (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieving outdated stock (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles (capacity <capacity>) depart from the design studio (<loc_depot>), visiting stores in flexible sequences. Drivers finish routes at the final boutique, eliminating redundant trips. The challenge is to maximize sample availability while minimizing transport costs.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (retrieving outdated stock) which can only be satisfied after delivering new collections (linehaul demand), and the vehicles do not return to the depot (open route). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPB' which combines open routes with backhaul constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMB, Predicted: OVRPMB, Index: 72
Description: A humanitarian organization distributes emergency supplies to disaster-stricken areas and later collects unused or expired items for redistribution or disposal. Each truck has a maximum capacity :math:`Q`, ensuring the total weight of deliveries and pickups stays within limits. The order of deliveries (supplies) and pickups (returned materials) can be arranged flexibly. The central warehouse and 20 affected locations are at <locs>. Delivery demands for relief supplies are <demand_linehaul>, and retrieval demands for returned items are <demand_backhaul>. The challenge is to plan efficient routes that balance aid distribution with material recovery to reduce costs and resource waste.
Reason: The problem involves both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) demands, and the order of deliveries and pickups can be arranged flexibly, which indicates a mixed backhaul scenario (MB). There is no mention of distance limits (L) or time windows (TW), and the vehicles are not required to return to the depot, which suggests an open route (O). The capacity constraint (C) is present but is secondary to the mixed backhaul and open route features.

Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 42
Description: A seafood company services offshore aquaculture cages (<loc_customer>) using boats that deliver feed (<demand_linehaul>) and harvest mature fish (<demand_backhaul>). Vessels with <capacity> ton limits must navigate tidal time windows (<time_windows>) when cages are accessible, completing routes within <time_limit> hours due to crew safety regulations. The mixed sequence of deliveries/pickups is constrained by perishability timelines for both feed and fresh catch.
Reason: The problem description includes capacity constraints (<capacity>), time windows (<time_windows>), and mixed backhaul demands (<demand_linehaul> and <demand_backhaul>). The mention of 'mixed sequence of deliveries/pickups' indicates that both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, which corresponds to 'MB'. Additionally, the tidal time windows and crew safety regulations imply time window constraints ('TW'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBTW'.

Description: Electric hearses (capacity: <capacity>) coordinate eco-friendly burials by delivering biodegradable caskets to families (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting floral tributes for composting (<demand_backhaul>) across cemeteries (<loc_customer>). Narrow time windows (<time_windows>) reflect funeral ceremony schedules. Routes respect cultural protocols (e.g., never transporting caskets and flowers simultaneously) while optimizing for battery range.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits due to battery range (L), and time windows (TW). Additionally, there is a constraint that caskets and flowers cannot be transported simultaneously, which implies that backhaul demand cannot be satisfied simultaneously with linehaul demand, ruling out 'MB' variants. The problem does not mention open routes (O), so we assume vehicles return to the depot. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 44
Description: A maintenance crew delivers replacement parts, repair tools, and safety gear to offshore wind turbines (linehaul) for scheduled upkeep. After repairs, they collect used materials and waste for disposal (backhaul). Time windows are dictated by tidal patterns and weather conditions, requiring precise arrival and departure times. Vehicles must deliver all linehaul items before initiating pickups, adhering to strict capacity (<capacity>) limits. Routes end at the last turbine visited, as returning to the depot risks missing optimal weather windows for subsequent missions.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demands (B) that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, time window constraints (TW) dictated by tidal patterns and weather conditions, and open routes (O) where vehicles do not return to the depot. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: An electric vehicle service provider operates battery-swap vans that simultaneously deliver charged batteries (<demand_linehaul>) and collect depleted units (<demand_backhaul>) at customer locations (<loc_customer>). Each van (<capacity>) starts at a charging depot (<loc_depot>) with limited daily operational range (<distance_limit>). Technicians end shifts at their final swap location without returning.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and open routes (O) where technicians end shifts at their final swap location without returning to the depot. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.

Boats (capacity: `<capacity>`) launch from a dockside warehouse (`<loc_depot>`). Tight time windows (`<time_windows>`) align with tidal patterns and market hours. Mixed sequences (MB) accommodate vendor needs, with boats docking at the last vendor (O) for overnight security.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhaul (MB), backhaul demand (B), time windows (TW), and open routes (O). The most specific variant that encompasses all these features is 'OVRPMBLTW', which includes open routes, mixed backhaul, backhaul demand, distance limits (implied by the context of boats on a river delta), and time windows.

Description: A catering company supplies cooking equipment (stoves, utensils, generators) to corporate event venues and later retrieves it. Deliveries must occur before pickups to ensure equipment readiness for events. Each truck has a capacity limit. Venues have setup time windows (before the event) and pickup deadlines afterward. The aim is to optimize routes for minimal distance, respecting capacity and time constraints, with vehicles ending their routes at the final pickup point.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demands (deliveries must occur before pickups), time window constraints (venues have setup time windows and pickup deadlines), and the vehicles do not return to the depot (they end their routes at the final pickup point). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.

Description: A nonprofit operates mobile vet clinics serving rural areas. Vehicles (capacity: `<capacity>`) start at a central hub (`<loc_depot>`), delivering vaccines/meds to clinics (`<demand_linehaul>`) and collecting used syringes/medical waste (`<demand_backhaul>`). Routes prioritize cost-efficient travel, and clinics can be visited in any order (e.g., waste pickup en route to next delivery). Vehicles remain at the final clinic for future operations.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles with capacity constraints ('C'), backhaul demand ('B') where waste is collected after deliveries are made, and open routes ('O') since vehicles remain at the final clinic and do not return to the depot. There is no mention of distance limits ('L') or time windows ('TW'). The backhaul is not mixed ('MB') because waste is collected only after all deliveries are completed. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPB'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 89
Description: A wellness company expands its network of mountain retreats, requiring delivery of exercise machines and yoga gear. Each retreat (<loc_customer>) has staff availability windows (<time_windows>) for unloading. Delivery vans (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a distribution center (<loc_depot>), but steep mountain roads restrict their travel range (<distance_limit> km). The goal is to schedule routes ensuring all equipment arrives within time constraints, while preventing overloading and avoiding route distances beyond the vans’ operational limits.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>) for unloading at each retreat, distance limits (<distance_limit> km) for the vans, and capacity constraints (<capacity> ton capacity). The vans do not necessarily have to return to the depot, but the description does not explicitly state that they must not return, so we assume they do. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPLTW', which accounts for vehicle distance limits and time windows.

Description: A movie studio dispatches vans (capacity: <capacity>) from its equipment depot (<loc_depot>) to deliver cameras/lights to shooting locations (<loc_customer>) and retrieve rented gear from wrap sites. Time windows (<time_windows>) align with shooting schedules. Vehicles may serve as "floating warehouses" after final stops. Optimize routes to minimize idle time between shoots while balancing delivery/pickup loads.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows ('TW') for shooting schedules, backhaul ('B') for retrieving rented gear, and mentions that vehicles may serve as 'floating warehouses' after final stops, implying open routes ('O'). The backhaul is only satisfied after all linehaul deliveries are completed, which is characteristic of backhaul ('B') rather than mixed backhaul ('MB'). There is no mention of distance limits ('L'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBTW'.

Description: A smart city operator deploys vehicles (capacity <capacity>) to empty waste bins (<demand_backhaul>) and repair IoT sensors (<demand_linehaul>) at locations (<locs>). Time windows (<time_windows>) reflect traffic avoidance policies (e.g., no collections during rush hour). Service times (<service_time>) vary for waste compaction vs. sensor calibration. Routes must dynamically interleave pickups and deliveries based on real-time fill-level alerts.
Reason: The problem description includes capacity constraints (<capacity>), backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>), linehaul demand (<demand_linehaul>), and time windows (<time_windows>). Additionally, the routes must dynamically interleave pickups and deliveries, which suggests mixed backhaul (MB) rather than strict backhaul (B). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBLTW', which accounts for capacity, mixed backhaul, linehaul, and time windows.

Description: Specialized vehicles (capacity: <capacity>) service commercial aquariums (<loc_customer>), delivering live fish/equipment (<demand_linehaul>) and transporting delicate specimens between facilities (<demand_backhaul>). Strict time windows (<time_windows>) account for feeding schedules and water temperature stability. Routes must balance tank space for incoming/outgoing marine life while prioritizing urgent transfers (e.g., sick animals to veterinary centers).
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>), time windows (<time_windows>), and the need to balance tank space for incoming/outgoing marine life, which implies simultaneous handling of linehaul and backhaul demand (mixed backhaul). Additionally, there is no mention of vehicles needing to return to the depot, suggesting open routes. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW', which accounts for open routes, mixed backhaul, distance limits (implied by tank space balancing), and time windows.

Description: A sports event organizer rents out tents, chairs, and portable stages to venues for marathons, concerts, or festivals. The equipment must be delivered to event sites first, followed by pickups after the events conclude. Each truck (capacity <capacity>) departs from the storage facility (<loc_depot>), prioritizing timely deliveries. After all setups are complete, the trucks collect the rented gear, ensuring that backhaul operations do not interfere with event timelines. Drivers finish routes at the final pickup point, avoiding return trips to the depot to save costs and resources.
Reason: The problem description involves backhaul operations (B) where equipment is picked up after all deliveries are completed, and the trucks do not return to the depot (O). Additionally, there is a mention of prioritizing timely deliveries, which implies time window constraints (TW). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes (O), backhaul (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).

Description: A maritime logistics company supplies safety equipment and emergency kits to offshore oil platforms and retrieves hazardous waste fluids for disposal. Vehicles must first deliver linehaul items (safety gear) before collecting backhaul waste. Each vessel has a limited capacity, and routes are constrained by a maximum distance to avoid extended fuel shortages. The challenge is to design paths that reach all platforms efficiently while adhering to both capacity and distance limits.
Reason: The problem description involves delivering linehaul items (safety gear) before collecting backhaul waste (B), vessels have distance limits (L), and there is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the problem is 'VRPBL', which combines backhaul demand and distance limits.

Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 5
Description: A pharmaceutical company distributes temperature-sensitive vaccines (<demand_linehaul>) to clinics while collecting expired medications (<demand_backhaul>) for safe disposal. Each refrigerated truck (<capacity>) departs from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>), visiting <num_customer> clinics (<loc_customer>) with strict time windows (<time_windows>) for deliveries (e.g., during operating hours) and pickups (e.g., before lab closures). Service times (<service_time>) account for temperature checks and paperwork. Routes must balance delivery priority and pickup urgency while avoiding capacity violations.
Reason: The problem description includes both linehaul (delivery of vaccines) and backhaul (collection of expired medications) demands, time windows for deliveries and pickups, and service times. The backhaul demand can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature. Additionally, there are strict time windows for both deliveries and pickups, which corresponds to the 'TW' (time window) feature. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), open routes ('O'), or mixed backhaul ('MB'), so these features are not considered. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW'.

Simultaneously, trucks must collect expired or unsold seafood (<demand_backhaul>) from the same restaurants for disposal. Each truck has a refrigerated capacity (<capacity>), and routes must balance deliveries and pickups in any order while adhering to time-sensitive constraints. The goal is to minimize spoilage and fuel costs while meeting all time windows.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (TW), backhaul demand (B), and the ability to balance deliveries and pickups in any order (MB), indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, the vehicles must adhere to time-sensitive constraints (TW). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'VRPMBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Load capacity, and Time Windows.

Description: During disaster recovery, a logistics team must deliver critical supplies (e.g., water, medical kits) to affected zones and collect hazardous waste (e.g., contaminated materials, debris) for disposal. Vehicles can prioritize either task first, but total cargo must stay within capacity limits. The challenge is to balance route efficiency with urgent service requirements.
Reason: The problem involves both delivery of critical supplies (linehaul) and collection of hazardous waste (backhaul), with the flexibility to prioritize either task first, indicating a mixed backhaul scenario (MB). There is no mention of vehicles needing to return to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). The problem also mentions balancing route efficiency with urgent service requirements, which implies time window constraints (TW). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBTW'.

Description: A school district needs to distribute science lab kits to schools for seasonal science fairs and collect them afterward. Each school has a time window for delivery setup and a separate window for post-event returns. Delivery trucks must first deliver the kits (linehaul) before returning to collect the used equipment (backhaul). Each truck has a capacity limit for both new and returned items. Routes must stay within a maximum distance to prevent driver exhaustion, ensuring all deliveries are completed before the fairs begin and pickups occur after the events conclude.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are time window constraints for both delivery and pickup (TW). Secondly, the problem involves backhaul demand (B), where trucks must first deliver kits (linehaul) before collecting used equipment (backhaul). Additionally, there is a distance limit for routes (L) to prevent driver exhaustion. These features collectively point to the 'VRPBLTW' variant, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.

Description: A gas supplier delivers full cylinders (<demand_linehaul>) to factories and retrieves empties (<demand_backhaul>) from the same or different sites (<loc_customer>). Trucks (capacity: <capacity> cylinders) from the depot (<loc_depot>) must sequence deliveries/pickups dynamically based on urgent needs, with routes capped at <distance_limit> km due to hazardous material transport regulations. Efficient routing prevents production stoppages at client facilities.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) where empty cylinders are picked up after delivering full ones, distance limits (L) due to hazardous material transport regulations, and the routes are dynamically sequenced based on urgent needs which implies time window constraints (TW). The problem does not specify that vehicles must return to the depot, suggesting open routes (O). However, the most specific variant that includes all these features is 'VRPMBLTW', which accounts for mixed backhaul (MB), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). The 'O' (open route) is not explicitly mentioned as a requirement, so 'VRPMBLTW' is chosen over 'OVRPMBLTW'.

Description: A chemical logistics company must deliver hazardous materials to industrial facilities (linehaul) and retrieve used containers for recycling (backhaul). Each delivery must occur within the client’s operational hours (TW), while pickups align with environmental regulations. Vehicles have strict capacity limits (C) to avoid overloading. Routes must stay within a daily distance limit (L) to comply with safety protocols. Starting from the depot, drivers first deliver chemicals, then collect waste containers, ending the route at the depot for proper disposal—ensuring no unnecessary return trips beyond the final task.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW). Additionally, the vehicles must return to the depot after completing deliveries and pickups, which rules out open route variants (O). The backhaul demand must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these constraints is 'VRPBLTW'.

Description: A salvage company operates in coastal regions, delivering tools and safety gear to accident sites and retrieving hazardous debris (e.g., oil-contaminated materials). Each salvage mission has a time window (<time_window>) determined by tidal conditions or regulatory deadlines. Salvage vessels (<capacity> ton capacity) must first offload supplies to the site before collecting waste, adhering to strict backhaul sequencing. Routes are limited by distance (<distance_limit>) due to fuel constraints and environmental permits requiring swift completion.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there is a backhaul sequencing requirement (B), where salvage vessels must offload supplies before collecting waste. Secondly, there are distance limits (L) due to fuel constraints and environmental permits. Thirdly, there are time window constraints (TW) determined by tidal conditions or regulatory deadlines. Additionally, the vessels do not necessarily have to return to the depot, indicating an open route (O).

Description: A utility company deploys new smart meters to residential neighborhoods while collecting outdated meters for recycling. Technicians must first deliver new meters (linehaul) within homeowners’ scheduled time windows, then return to retrieve the old units (backhaul). Each van’s capacity restricts the number of meters it can carry. Routes are capped at a distance limit to ensure timely service, with all installations finalized before the next billing cycle and pickups completed within a week.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features: 1) Time windows for delivering new meters (TW), 2) Backhaul demand for retrieving old meters (B), and 3) Distance limits for routes (L). The backhaul demand must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is met, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). The routes are not specified as open (they likely return to the depot), so 'O' is not applicable. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.

Label: VRPMB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 14
Description: A rental company supplies staging equipment and tents to event venues and later collects them post-event. Each truck must handle both outbound deliveries and inbound pickups within its :math:`Q` capacity, with stops arranged in any order to maximize route efficiency. The central warehouse and 20 event locations are at <locs>, with delivery demands of <demand_linehaul> and pickup needs of <demand_backhaul>. The challenge is coordinating delivery and collection phases without exceeding vehicle limits while minimizing operational costs and downtime between events.
Reason: The problem involves both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) demands, with the constraint that pickups can only be done after all deliveries are completed. This matches the 'B' (backhaul) feature. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), or open routes ('O'), so these features are not considered. The problem also involves vehicle capacity constraints, but since 'B' is present, 'C' is ignored. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPB'.

Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 8
Description: Research vessels depart from a coastal base (<loc_depot>) to deploy sensors (<demand_linehaul>) at ocean sites (<loc_customer>) and retrieve logged data (<demand_backhaul>). Ships (capacity: <capacity>) cannot exceed <distance_limit> nautical miles per trip due to fuel constraints. Routes terminate at the final research site, allowing vessels to remain on standby for further missions.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B') where sensors are deployed (linehaul) and data is retrieved (backhaul), distance limits ('L') due to fuel constraints, and open routes ('O') where vessels terminate at the final research site without returning to the depot. There is no mention of time windows ('TW') or mixed backhaul ('MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 19
Description: A meal kit subscription service delivers perishable ingredients in reusable containers and collects empty containers for sterilization. Vehicles have a capacity of <capacity> containers. Deliveries to subscribers must happen before pickups to avoid contamination risks. Subscribers specify time windows <time_windows> based on their daily routines (e.g., morning or evening slots). The challenge is to design routes that minimize delays, respect strict delivery/pickup sequences, and ensure containers are returned promptly without overloading the trucks.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there is a capacity constraint ('C') mentioned for the vehicles. Second, there is a backhaul demand ('B') where empty containers must be picked up after deliveries to avoid contamination, which is a strict sequence. Third, subscribers specify time windows ('TW') for deliveries and pickups. Additionally, the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot after completing their routes, which suggests an open route ('O'). Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBTW', which includes open routes, backhaul demands, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 41
Description: An environmental agency maintains a network of air quality sensors across metropolitan areas. Service vehicles depart from the lab (<loc_depot>) carrying calibration equipment (<demand_linehaul>) and empty storage drives (<capacity>), visiting sensor nodes (<loc_customer>) to perform maintenance while collecting pollution data (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have strict range limits (<distance_limit>) due to electric battery constraints. The optimal routing must allow technicians to service sensors in any order, combining calibration and data collection tasks efficiently without exceeding vehicle capacities or range limitations.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (calibration equipment) and backhaul (pollution data) demands, which can be satisfied simultaneously (mixed backhaul). Additionally, the vehicles have strict range limits (distance limits). There is no mention of time windows or the requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, so 'TW' and 'O' are not considered. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPMBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 2
Description: A cooperative delivers fresh produce (demand: <demand_linehaul>) from a central hub (<loc_depot>) to restaurants (<loc_customer>) and retrieves empty crates (<demand_backhaul>) for reuse. Restaurants impose morning delivery windows (<time_windows>) to align with kitchen prep schedules. Vehicles (capacity: <capacity>) must balance crate space for deliveries (e.g., tomatoes) and pickups (empty crates), sequencing stops flexibly (e.g., deliver to Restaurant X, pick up crates at Restaurant Y, then deliver to Z) to avoid spoilage and minimize detours.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), time windows (TW), and allows for mixed backhaul (MB) where linehaul and backhaul can be satisfied simultaneously. The vehicles do not have to return to the depot (O) is not mentioned, so it is not considered. The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'VRPMBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 63
Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile testing units (capacity: <capacity>) to visit clinics (<loc_customer>), conducting tests while redistributing surplus PPE supplies between locations. Clinics have time-sensitive testing windows (<time_windows>) and service times (<service_time>) for sample collection. Vehicles must balance test kit deliveries and supply pickups in any sequence, staying within daily operational limits (<distance_limit>) to maintain cold chain integrity. Demand (<demand>) includes both test kits delivered and supplies collected.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there are time-sensitive testing windows (<time_windows>), which correspond to 'TW' (time window constraints). Second, the vehicles must balance test kit deliveries (linehaul) and supply pickups (backhaul) in any sequence, which aligns with 'MB' (mixed backhaul) since both types of demand can be satisfied simultaneously. Third, the vehicles have daily operational limits (<distance_limit>), which corresponds to 'L' (distance limits). Additionally, the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot, which aligns with 'O' (open route). Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 50
Description: A solar energy company must deliver newly manufactured solar panels to remote rural communities (linehaul) and simultaneously collect used lithium-ion batteries from previous installations (backhaul). Each truck has a capacity of <capacity> kg, requiring careful balancing between the weight of panels and the volume of returned batteries. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius to ensure vehicles can return to the depot before depleting fuel, especially in rugged terrain. The goal is to optimize delivery efficiency while adhering to environmental regulations for battery disposal.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering solar panels) and backhaul (collecting used batteries) demands, which can be satisfied simultaneously (mixed backhaul). Additionally, there is a distance limit constraint (L) that restricts routes to a certain radius. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O), so these are not considered. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPMBL', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Distance Limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 97
Description: A rescue team deploys emergency kits, medical supplies, and climbing gear to remote mountain shelters (linehaul) and later retrieves used equipment for maintenance. The vehicles must deliver critical supplies first, then collect returned gear. Each vehicle has a capacity limit, and routes must stay within a distance threshold to ensure rescuers can return safely without refueling. The goal is to service all shelters while minimizing total travel distance and respecting operational constraints.
Reason: The problem involves delivering critical supplies (linehaul) first and then collecting returned gear (backhaul), which matches the 'B' (backhaul) feature. Additionally, the vehicles have distance limits ('L') to ensure they can return safely without refueling. There is no mention of time windows ('TW') or open routes ('O'), and the backhaul must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is met, which is characteristic of 'B' rather than 'MB'. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 37
Description: Apiary technicians service commercial beehives (<loc_customer>) distributed across city rooftops from a central depot (<loc_depot>). Vehicles (capacity <capacity>) carry both replacement bee colonies (<demand_linehaul>) and collect honey (<demand_backhaul>), with stops sequenceable based on hive inspection needs. Daily routes are capped at <distance_limit> km to ensure bee survival during transport. Technicians end routes at final hive locations for overnight monitoring.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (collecting honey) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand (replacing bee colonies) is satisfied ('B'), distance limits on daily routes ('L'), and the fact that technicians end routes at final hive locations for overnight monitoring (open routes, 'O'). There is no mention of time window constraints ('TW'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL' which combines open routes, backhaul demand, and distance limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 67
Description: An airport catering service must:  
- Deliver pre-ordered meals from kitchens (<loc_depot>) to aircraft (<loc_customer>) during boarding windows (<time_windows>)  
- Collect unused meals and trash (MB)  
- Operate within strict tarmac driving time limits (L)  
Refrigerated trucks (<capacity>) complete routes without returning to base (O), prioritizing flights by departure time.
Reason: The problem description includes the following features: backhaul demand (collecting unused meals and trash - 'B'), distance limits (strict tarmac driving time limits - 'L'), time windows (boarding windows - 'TW'), and open routes (trucks do not return to base - 'O'). The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 55
Description: A tech company must replace outdated servers at scattered data centers. Each data center has a scheduled maintenance window (TW) when engineers can perform the swap. Trucks depart from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering new servers (linehaul) to each site, then collecting the obsolete hardware (backhaul) for recycling. The vehicles have a strict capacity (<capacity>) to handle both outbound and inbound loads. Routes must ensure deliveries precede pickups, with drivers ending their shift at the final collection point without returning to base.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, time window constraints (TW) for each data center's maintenance window, and open routes (O) where vehicles do not return to the depot after the final collection. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 49
Description: A wine distributor delivers temperature-sensitive bottles to high-end restaurants and retailers, then collects empty crates for reuse. Deliveries require strict time windows to avoid heat exposure, while pickups occur during off-peak hours. Vehicle capacities are limited by crate dimensions and wine bottle fragility. Backhaul pickups are scheduled after all deliveries to ensure restaurants receive stock before service hours, with time windows enforced to optimize refrigeration during transit.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demands (B) that can only be satisfied after all linehaul deliveries are completed, time window constraints (TW) for both deliveries and pickups, and there is no mention of vehicles needing to return to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which combines open routes, backhaul demands, distance limits (implied by vehicle capacities and fragility constraints), and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 38
Description: Airport ground crews must deploy baggage carts and service equipment to aircraft gates before flight operations begin and retrieve them afterward. Each gate has a delivery time window (during pre-flight setup) and a retrieval window (post-flight). Equipment deliveries (linehaul) must occur first, followed by pickups (backhaul), ensuring vehicles do not overload with both outgoing and returned gear. Routes finish at the last retrieval location to streamline operations.
Reason: The problem description involves backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, time window constraints (TW) for deliveries and retrievals, and the routes finish at the last retrieval location indicating an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 60
Description: A mobile dental service visits schools and community centers (<loc_customer>) to provide check-ups and collect used equipment for sterilization. Each location has a specific time window (<time_windows>) for visits due to scheduling constraints. Vehicles start at a central clinic (<loc_depot>) with portable dental chairs (<capacity>), deliver clean equipment, and collect used tools in any order. After the final stop, vehicles remain on-site for next-day operations without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demands (collecting used equipment), and open routes (vehicles do not return to the depot). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 66
Description: A tech firm deploys trucks (<capacity>) from <loc_depot> to deliver new laptops (<demand_linehaul>) to offices (<loc_customer>) and retrieve outdated devices (<demand_backhaul>) for recycling. Time-critical deliveries (<time_windows>) must align with office hours, while pickups can occur flexibly during the same route. Mixed backhauls enable efficient same-trip handling of both tasks.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhauls ('MB'), time windows ('TW'), and capacity constraints ('C'). However, since 'MB' and 'TW' are present, the capacity constraint is ignored as per the given rules. The most specific variant that includes both mixed backhauls and time windows is 'VRPMBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 20
Description: A blood donation organization operates mobile units that visit various locations (<loc_customer>) to collect donations while also returning processed blood samples to the central lab (<loc_depot>). Each unit has a <capacity> limit for both fresh donations and samples, and must adhere to strict time windows (<time_windows>) due to donor appointments and sample viability constraints. Routes must optimize travel distance while ensuring no unit exceeds its operational duration limit (<distance_limit>).
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (returning processed blood samples to the central lab), distance limits (operational duration limit), and time windows (strict time windows due to donor appointments and sample viability constraints). Additionally, the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot after completing their routes, indicating an open route. The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 70
Description: Museums worldwide loan priceless artifacts to temporary exhibitions, requiring precise logistics. Vehicles must transport fragile items from a central depot (<loc_depot>) to exhibition venues (<loc_customer>), each with specific time windows (<time_windows>) to align with installation schedules. Each truck has a limited cargo capacity (<capacity>) to protect artifacts from overcrowding, and routes must stay within a maximum distance (<distance_limit>) to prevent extended exposure to vibrations. The goal is to ensure artifacts arrive undamaged and on time while minimizing total travel distance.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), distance limits (<distance_limit>), and cargo capacity (<capacity>). The vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot, which is implied by the focus on transporting items to exhibition venues without mentioning return trips. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits and Time Windows.
