Description: Technicians maintain IoT sensors across a city (<loc_customer>) starting from a service center (<loc_depot>). Vehicles carry limited replacement parts (<capacity>) and must complete routes within battery life constraints (<distance_limit>). Some stops require sensor calibration (time-sensitive procedures with fixed <time_windows>) while others involve part replacements or data collection (flexible timing). Calibration procedures have strict duration requirements (<service_time>). The challenge is to optimize routes that respect all technical constraints while minimizing downtown of critical city infrastructure.
Reason: The problem description mentions that vehicles have limited replacement parts (capacity), must complete routes within battery life constraints (distance limit), and some stops require sensor calibration with fixed time windows. There is no mention of backhaul or open route requirements, so the most specific variant that fits this scenario includes capacity (C), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).

Description: A catering service delivers boxed meals (<demand_linehaul>) to corporate events across the city, each with specific time windows (<time_windows>) for arrival. After the events, the same trucks must retrieve disposable dishware (<demand_backhaul>). Deliveries must precede pickups to avoid contamination risks. Vehicles (<capacity>) must balance perishable meal loads and post-event waste without exceeding capacity. Drivers end routes at the final dish collection point to minimize idle time.
Reason: The problem description includes specific time windows for deliveries (TW), the need to handle both linehaul and backhaul demands where deliveries must precede pickups (B), and capacity constraints on vehicles (C). There is no mention of distance limits (L) or open routes (O). The most fitting variant that encompasses these characteristics is VRPBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows.

Description: A tech company operates a fleet of mobile repair vans that deliver refurbished devices (laptops, phones) to customers while collecting broken electronics for recycling. Each van (capacity <capacity>) starts at the service center (<loc_depot>), visits mixed delivery/pickup locations (<loc_customer>), and ends at the final stop. Deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) and e-waste pickups (<demand_backhaul>) can occur in any order, optimizing routes to minimize mileage while respecting vehicle capacity constraints.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the vans have a capacity constraint, and both deliveries (linehaul) and e-waste pickups (backhaul) can occur in any order. This indicates a mixed backhaul situation where linehaul and backhaul demands are satisfied simultaneously without the need for all linehaul demand to be met before backhaul. There is no mention of distance limits, open routes, or time windows, which rules out the "L", "O", and "TW" variants. The most specific variant fitting this description is VRPMB, indicating a Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul.

Description: A high-end fashion brand circulates seasonal samples to `<num_customer>` boutique stores (`<loc_customer>`) from a showroom (`<loc_depot>`). Trucks (`<capacity>`) must:  
- **Deliver** new collections (`<demand_linehaul>`).  
- **Retrieve** unsold items (`<demand_backhaul>`).  
Stores can be visited in any sequence (e.g., deliver to Store A, pick up from Store B, then deliver to Store C). Drivers conclude routes at the final store, eliminating return trips. Optimizing routes reduces fuel costs and ensures fresh inventory.
Reason: The problem description mentions delivering new collections and retrieving unsold items, which indicates a backhaul requirement. It also specifies that the drivers conclude their routes at the final store, eliminating return trips, indicating an open route. There is no mention of distance limits or time window constraints for the deliveries and pickups.

Description: Research vessels (<capacity>) service a network of marine buoys (<loc_customer>) from a coastal base (<loc_depot>). Some buoys require sensor replacements (<demand_linehaul>) while others need data retrieval (<demand_backhaul>). Vessels can service buoys in any order but face <distance_limit> nautical mile range limits due to fuel constraints. The challenge is to maximize scientific data recovery while minimizing operational costs across the buoy network.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the research vessels have a capacity constraint, which aligns with the "C" (capacity) feature. Additionally, there is a distance limit due to fuel constraints, corresponding to the "L" (distance limits) feature. The requirement to service both sensor replacements (linehaul demand) and data retrieval (backhaul demand) simultaneously suggests the "MB" (mixed backhaul) feature. Since no information about open routes or time windows was provided, the most fitting variant is VRPMBL, combining mixed backhaul demands and distance limitations.

Description: A marine services firm supplies fishing vessels with equipment like nets and buoys while retrieving damaged or outdated gear for recycling. The mixed backhaul model allows drivers to alternate between delivering new gear to docks and collecting old gear from fishing ports. For example, a truck might deliver anchors to one harbor and then pick up discarded nets from another. The vehicle’s capacity <capacity> must account for both the bulky new equipment and the compacted waste.

Description: Service vessels (<capacity>) transport crews from shore bases (<loc_depot>) to multiple wind turbines (<loc_customer>), both delivering technicians and retrieving completed work teams. Routes dynamically mix drop-offs and pickups based on real-time maintenance needs, constrained by <distance_limit> nautical mile range limits. Vessels remain near the final turbine cluster after completing service rounds.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vessels have a capacity constraint, but this is overshadowed by other more specific constraints. The most significant aspects are the distance limit for each vessel and the fact that the routes are open (vessels do not return to the shore base after completing their service rounds). There is no explicit mention of time windows or backhaul demands. Thus, the "O" (open route) and "L" (distance limits) attributes are key, leading to the selection of OVRPL as the most fitting variant.

Label: OVRP, Predicted: CVRP, Index: 54
Description: A mining operation requires regular tool and spare part deliveries to remote drilling sites (<loc_customer>) scattered across rugged terrain. Supplies originate from a central storage facility (<loc_depot>). Each site’s tool demand (<demand>) must be met, but trucks have limited cargo space (<capacity>). Routes must avoid overloading vehicles and prioritize efficiency, as drivers conclude their shift at the final site to assist with installation. The aim is to reduce logistics costs while ensuring critical equipment reaches all mining crews.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each site’s tool demand must be met, and trucks have limited cargo space. This indicates a capacity constraint (C). Additionally, the mention of prioritizing efficiency in routes suggests there might be an implicit consideration for distance, but no explicit distance limit is stated. The problem also does not mention any backhaul demands, open routes, or time windows. Therefore, the most specific variant without additional constraints beyond capacity is CVRP.

Description: A retailer hosts temporary pop-up stores in urban centers, needing to deliver merchandise (linehaul) before event opening hours (<time_windows>) and collect unsold items (backhaul) after closing. Each delivery van (capacity <capacity>) must fully stock kiosks first, then retrieve excess inventory during teardown. Routes finish at a regional distribution center, bypassing the main warehouse to accelerate restocking for the next location. The challenge is balancing load limits while ensuring pop-ups open on time and excess goods are recovered efficiently, avoiding costly overstock or understock scenarios.
Reason: The problem description specifies the need for time windows for both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul), which aligns with the "TW" constraint. Additionally, it mentions that backhaul (collecting unsold items) happens only after all kiosks are fully stocked, fitting the "B" backhaul requirement. The presence of a capacity limit on the delivery vans is also noted, but since other features ("TW", "B") are present, the "C" (capacity) tag is not explicitly required in the variant name. There is no mention of open routes or distance limits, so "O" and "L" tags are not applicable. Therefore, the most suitable variant is VRPBTW.

Description: A biotech company operates a program to replace outdated lab equipment with cutting-edge models. Their logistics team must deliver new equipment (linehaul) to research facilities while collecting the obsolete devices (backhaul) for recycling. Each lab has a strict operational window for equipment swaps to avoid disrupting experiments, with service times requiring precise coordination. Vehicles are limited to a 200km route distance to ensure rapid deployment, and their capacity must accommodate both new gear and bulky old equipment. Routes conclude at the final lab without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles have a distance limit (200km), there are strict time windows for service to avoid disrupting experiments, and the operation involves both delivering new equipment (linehaul) and collecting old equipment (backhaul). Additionally, the routes conclude at the final lab without returning to the depot, which points to an open route. These characteristics align with the OVRPMBLTW variant, representing Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhauls, Limited Distance, and Time Windows.

Description: A retail distributor supplies new inventory to stores and collects damaged or expired items for return to the warehouse. Deliveries of new stock must precede pickups of damaged goods. Each truck’s capacity restricts the total weight of both outbound and inbound items. Routes conclude at the final damaged goods pickup, ensuring cost-effective logistics and efficient reverse supply chain management.
Reason: The problem description mentions that deliveries of new stock (linehaul) must precede pickups of damaged goods (backhaul), and each truck’s capacity restricts the total weight of both outbound and inbound items. This indicates a backhaul situation where linehaul demand is satisfied before backhaul, fitting the "B" (backhaul) characteristic. Additionally, there are time window constraints as the routes conclude at the final damaged goods pickup, which aligns with the "TW" (time window) characteristic. The specific variant VRPBTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows) best captures these requirements.

Description: A cruise line’s logistics team must restock ships at sea with perishable groceries (<demand_linehaul>), medical supplies, and spare parts while collecting hazardous waste and recyclables (<demand_backhaul>). Supply boats depart from a coastal depot (<loc_depot>), with strict <time_windows> aligned to ship docking schedules. Each vessel has a <capacity> ton limit and must return within <distance_limit> nautical miles to avoid delays in subsequent port calls. Deliveries must precede pickups to prevent contamination of food supplies during waste collection, and routes must account for fluctuating tides affecting docking access times.
Reason: The problem description indicates several key features: the presence of both linehaul (perishable groceries, medical supplies, and spare parts) and backhaul (hazardous waste and recyclables) demands, with the requirement that deliveries must precede pickups to prevent contamination. Additionally, there are strict time windows for deliveries and collections aligned with ship docking schedules, a capacity limit for each vessel, and a distance limit for the round trip. These constraints point towards a variant that supports mixed backhaul (MB), has time window constraints (TW), and includes vehicle capacity and distance limits. The 'O' (open route) is not applicable as the supply boats must return to the coastal depot. Given these requirements, VRPMBLTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Limited Distance, and Time Windows) best fits the scenario.

Description: A scooter-sharing company must rebalance their fleet across the city. During peak hours, empty scooters are delivered from low-traffic zones to high-demand areas (linehaul), while damaged or low-battery units are collected from scattered drop-off points (backhaul). Each delivery truck (capacity <capacity>) must prioritize restocking busy zones before sunset (time windows) to maximize rental opportunities. After their final stop—whether a repair hub or storage lot—the drivers end their routes without returning to the central depot. The challenge is to ensure scooters are deployed on time while efficiently consolidating returns without overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles have a capacity limit, and there are both linehaul (delivering scooters to high-demand areas) and backhaul (collecting damaged or low-battery units) operations. Additionally, it mentions time window constraints for restocking busy zones before sunset, and the routes are open, meaning the drivers do not return to the central depot after their final stop. The "MB" (mixed backhaul) attribute is more appropriate here as it allows for both linehaul and backhaul demands to be satisfied simultaneously, and the presence of "O" (open route), "TW" (time windows), and "B" (backhaul) in the context makes OVRPMBLTW the most fitting variant.

Description: A major sports tournament organizer needs to deliver equipment like goalposts, scoreboards, and safety gear to multiple venues (linehaul) before scheduled matches. Each venue has strict setup time windows to ensure readiness. After the events, they must collect the equipment (backhaul) without returning to the central warehouse. Vehicles must prioritize deliveries before pickups, adhere to capacity limits, and navigate time-sensitive venue schedules to avoid delays.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: 1) backhaul (collecting equipment after the events), which can only be done after all deliveries (linehaul) are completed, 2) there is no need for vehicles to return to the central warehouse after completing their tasks, indicating an open route, and 3) strict setup time windows at each venue, meaning that there are time window constraints. The presence of these features rules out the simple CVRP variant. Among the options provided, VRPBLTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls, Linehauls, and Time Windows) closely matches the requirements but misses the open route aspect. However, OVRPBLTW (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls, Linehauls, and Time Windows) fully captures all specified conditions, including the open nature of the routes, making it the most suitable choice.

Each repair site has tidal-based time windows (<time_windows>) during which vessels can dock safely. The maintenance vessels (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a coastal base (<loc_depot>), carrying specialized equipment. They must complete repairs before exhausting their fuel range (<distance_limit> km), as mid-ocean refueling is impossible. The goal is to plan routes that deliver all required gear to each site within their tidal windows, while ensuring no vessel exceeds its load or travel limits.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple key attributes: the maintenance vessels have a capacity limit, a distance (fuel) limit, and there are tidal-based time windows for when the repairs can be done. There is no mention of backhaul or open routes, so we focus on the constraints that are present. The presence of capacity, distance limits, and time windows aligns with the VRPBLTW variant.

Description: Mobile healthcare units travel to rural clinics to deliver medical supplies (linehaul), such as vaccines and medications, and collect blood or diagnostic samples (backhaul) for lab analysis. Clinics specify **time windows** for when staff are available to receive or provide samples. Each mobile unit has a **capacity limit** for both supplies and samples, and routes must stay within a **distance limit** to ensure timely returns for sample processing. The challenge is to plan routes that prioritize deliveries first, respect clinic schedules, and prevent overloading the vehicle while covering all remote locations efficiently.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the mobile healthcare units have to deliver medical supplies (linehaul) and collect samples (backhaul), indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, there are capacity limits for both supplies and samples, distance limits for routes, and specific time windows during which clinics can receive or provide items. Since the problem does not mention an open route, we do not include the "O" feature. The most appropriate variant that encompasses all these characteristics is VRPMBLTW.

Description: A grocery service delivers perishable goods in reusable containers to urban households and collects empties for reuse. Deliveries (linehaul) of groceries must occur before pickups (backhaul) of containers. Customers specify time windows for deliveries (e.g., work hours) and pickups (e.g., evenings). Vehicles adhere to capacity limits for both goods and containers, cannot exceed daily distance limits, and end routes at the last stop. This minimizes carbon footprint while ensuring fresh deliveries and efficient container recycling.
Reason: The problem description includes specific requirements that align with several key attributes: the need for vehicles to adhere to capacity limits (C), the presence of both linehaul and backhaul operations where deliveries must occur before pickups (B), daily distance limits for vehicles (L), and time window constraints for both deliveries and pickups (TW). The scenario also specifies that routes end at the last stop, which implies a closed route structure, not an open one. Thus, the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW, capturing all these specific requirements.

Description: An airport ground handler delivers checked luggage to departing flight gates (linehaul) and collects inbound cargo shipments (backhaul) from arriving flights. Each task is time-sensitive: luggage must reach gates before boarding, while cargo pickups align with flight arrival times. Vehicles must complete luggage deliveries before cargo pickups and adhere to strict capacity limits for mixed cargo types. Routes are constrained by airport perimeter distance limits to ensure timely turnaround.
Reason: The problem description mentions that vehicles must complete luggage deliveries (linehaul) before cargo pickups (backhaul), adhering to strict capacity limits for mixed cargo types, and routes are constrained by airport perimeter distance limits. Additionally, the tasks are time-sensitive, indicating there are time window constraints. Given these conditions, the variant VRPMBLTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Linehaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows) is the most appropriate as it covers all the specified requirements: mixed backhaul/linehaul, vehicle distance limits, and time window constraints.

Couriers transport new watches (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieve unsold models (<demand_backhaul>) using secure vans (<capacity>). Deliveries and pickups can occur in any sequence, and vans remain at the last showroom for security. The goal is to balance inventory across locations efficiently, ensuring no van exceeds its carrying capacity.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (transporting new watches to showrooms) and backhaul (retrieving unsold models from showrooms) demands, with the requirement that vans can handle both types of demands simultaneously. This points towards a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, there is a capacity constraint for the secure vans, which is a standard feature in these problems but does not change the classification here due to the presence of more specific attributes. The problem does not specify any distance limits, time window constraints, or that the routes are open (i.e., vehicles do not have to return to the depot), leading us to select VRPMB as the most fitting variant.

Description: A festival organizer needs to deploy stages, generators, and tents (linehaul) to multiple outdoor venues before events. After the events, trucks collect recyclable materials like plastic waste and unused supplies (backhaul). Each venue specifies a setup time window (TW) for equipment delivery and a teardown window for waste pickup. Vehicles must first complete all deliveries before initiating pickups, ensuring their total load (equipment + recyclables) never exceeds capacity (<capacity>). Drivers finish routes at the last recycling collection site.
Reason: The problem description indicates the need for capacity constraints (equipment + recyclables), backhaul (collection of recyclable materials and unused supplies after events), and time window constraints (setup and teardown windows). It also specifies that vehicles must complete all deliveries before initiating pickups, which aligns with the "B" (backhaul) requirement rather than "MB" (mixed backhaul). The scenario does not mention any distance limits ("L") or the necessity for an open route ("O"). Therefore, the most specific variant that fits is VRPBTW.

Description: A rural service provider rents irrigation systems to farmers during planting seasons. Trucks depart from a central depot (<loc_depot>) to deliver heavy machinery (<demand_linehaul>) to farms (<loc_customer>). After harvest, they collect the equipment for maintenance. Deliveries must occur before pickups to avoid disrupting crop cycles. The vehicle capacity (<capacity> ton) must accommodate both outbound machinery and inbound returns without overloading. Routes conclude at the last pickup point, ensuring efficient post-harvest logistics.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the deliveries (linehaul) must occur before pickups (backhaul), and both types of demands need to be managed within the vehicle capacity. This indicates a backhaul situation where backhaul demand is only satisfied after all linehaul demand, fitting the "B" classification. Additionally, there is a mention of capacity constraints for the vehicles, which fits the "C" classification. However, since "B" takes precedence over "C" when present, the most specific variant is VRPB.

A machinery provider must transport equipment from a storage facility (<loc_depot>) to farms (<loc_customer>), each needing a specific number of machines (<demand>). Trucks have a <capacity> ton limit, and deliveries must align with farmers’ planting/harvest schedules (time windows: e.g., “arrive by Day 3 for wheat fields, Day 5 for corn”). Routes end at the last farm served, ensuring efficient use of machinery and labor.
Reason: The problem description specifies that there are time window constraints (e.g., "arrive by Day 3 for wheat fields, Day 5 for corn"), which aligns with the "TW" attribute. Additionally, the trucks have a capacity limit, which is a common feature in VRP and does not change the variant since it is implied unless specifically excluded or superseded by other attributes like backhauls or open routes. There is no mention of backhaul, distance limits, or the need for an open route, thus the most fitting variant is VRPTW.

Each truck has limited storage (<capacity>) and must complete routes in <time_limit> hours to maintain food freshness. Trucks remain at their final venue for overnight parking.
Reason: The problem description mentions that trucks have limited storage (capacity), need to collect waste (backhaul demand) while also servicing the venues (linehaul demand), and must operate within specific time slots (time windows). Additionally, the description specifies that the trucks remain at their final venue for overnight parking, indicating an open route.

Description: Hospitals across a region require daily exchanges of clean linens and the retrieval of soiled laundry. Linen trucks must first deliver fresh linens (linehaul) to hospitals before morning shifts, adhering to strict time windows to avoid disrupting patient care. After deliveries, the same trucks collect soiled linens (backhaul) from the same locations. Each truck has a maximum capacity for both clean and soiled loads, and routes must stay within a daily distance limit to comply with driver hour regulations. The challenge is to balance route efficiency, capacity constraints, and time windows while ensuring timely service for all healthcare facilities.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks have a maximum capacity for both clean and soiled loads, indicating a capacity constraint. It also mentions that the trucks must adhere to strict time windows for deliveries and collections, which aligns with the "TW" (time window) feature. Additionally, the scenario involves delivering fresh linens (linehaul) and then collecting soiled linens (backhaul), but it does not state that backhaul can only occur after all linehaul is completed, suggesting a mixed backhaul ("MB") situation. The presence of a daily distance limit for compliance with driver hour regulations points to a "L" (distance limit) characteristic. Since the problem does not indicate that the routes are open (i.e., vehicles do not need to return to the depot), we exclude "O". Combining these features, the most specific variant that fits this description is VRPMBLTW.

Description: A pharmaceutical distributor must deliver temperature-sensitive vaccines (<demand_linehaul>) to healthcare centers and collect expired medical supplies (<demand_backhaul>) for disposal. Vaccines must be delivered within strict time windows (<time_window>) to maintain cold-chain integrity, while pickups must follow delivery routes to avoid cross-contamination. Each refrigerated truck has a <capacity> kg limit and a maximum route distance of <distance_limit> km to prevent refrigeration failure. The challenge is optimizing routes to ensure all centers are serviced efficiently without exceeding capacity or distance constraints.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering vaccines) and backhaul (collecting expired medical supplies) demands, with the condition that pickups must follow delivery routes. This indicates a mixed backhaul scenario (MB). Additionally, there are strict time windows for deliveries (TW) to maintain cold-chain integrity, and each truck has a capacity (C) and distance limit (L). The variant VRPMBLTW captures all these aspects: mixed backhaul, time window constraints, capacity, and distance limits.

Service trucks (capacity <capacity>) begin at the supply center (<loc_depot>) to deliver fish feed and seedlings (<demand_linehaul>) to some units (<loc_customer>), while collecting mature crops (<demand_backhaul>) from others in flexible sequences. Vehicle capacity governs the combined weight of delivered supplies and harvested produce, with routes terminating at the final service point.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the service trucks have a capacity constraint, and they are involved in both delivering supplies (linehaul) and collecting crops (backhaul) with no strict order. Since the backhaul demand is collected from different units and there is no indication that it can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands, this points towards a mixed backhaul scenario. There is no mention of distance limits, time windows, or the need for the routes to be open (i.e., not returning to the depot). Thus, the most fitting variant, considering the presence of capacity and mixed backhaul, without other specific constraints, is VRPMB.

Vehicles start at a central hub (<loc_depot>) with limited medical supplies (<capacity>). Clinics operate at schools and community centers (<loc_customer>) during strict time slots (<time_windows>). Teams remain at the final location for follow-up work, eliminating return trips.
Reason: The problem description mentions that vehicles start at a central hub with limited medical supplies, indicating a capacity constraint (C). It also specifies that clinics operate during strict time slots, which implies time window constraints (TW). The description further states that teams remain at the final location for follow-up work, eliminating return trips, which fits the open route (O) characteristic. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is OVRPTW.

Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 26
Description: A company rents out projectors and AV equipment to businesses for events. Deliveries (linehaul) must arrive before client events start (TW), and pickups (backhaul) must occur after events end. Each location has specific time windows for service. Vehicles must balance outgoing equipment and returned items within capacity limits. The objective is optimized routes to reduce costs and ensure timely service.
Reason: The problem description mentions that deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) must occur within specific time windows, indicating a need for time window constraints (TW). It also specifies that vehicles must balance outgoing equipment and returned items, suggesting a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario where both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously. The presence of capacity limits is also noted, but since the MB and TW features are more specific, they take precedence over the general capacity constraint. Therefore, the most appropriate variant that fits all these criteria is VRPMBTW.

Description: A high-end hospitality group uses vans (capacity: <capacity>) to deliver fresh linens and toiletries (<demand_linehaul>) to hotels (<loc_customer>) while collecting used items for laundering (<demand_backhaul>). Deliveries must align with hotels’ strict restocking schedules (<time_windows>), and routes cannot exceed shift durations (<time_limit>). Vehicles may alternate deliveries and pickups dynamically to minimize idle time.
Reason: The problem description mentions a vehicle capacity, strict restocking schedules (time windows), and the need to both deliver fresh linens and toiletries as well as collect used items (mixed backhaul) while adhering to shift durations. The presence of mixed backhaul (MB), time window constraints (TW), and the implicit mention of vehicle capacity (C) aligns with the VRPMBTW variant. There is no explicit requirement for open routes or distance limits, so 'O' and 'L' are not included.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 13
Description: A healthcare logistics firm delivers fresh linens and medical supplies to hospitals (linehaul) and collects soiled laundry (backhaul). Hospitals enforce strict access times (time windows) to avoid disrupting patient care. Trucks must deliver critical supplies first, then collect contaminated linens in sealed bins. Capacity constraints (<capacity> kg) require careful load balancing, and routes terminate at the final hospital to minimize travel.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key aspects: the presence of both linehaul (delivering fresh linens and medical supplies) and backhaul (collecting soiled laundry) operations, strict access times (time windows), and capacity constraints. It also specifies that trucks must deliver critical supplies first before collecting contaminated linens, indicating a mixed backhaul operation where both types of demand can be satisfied simultaneously. The need for careful load balancing points to capacity being a significant constraint. Since the routes terminate at the final hospital rather than returning to the depot, this suggests an open route. However, the main differentiators here are the time window constraints, capacity constraints, and the mixed backhaul nature of the operations, making VRPMBLTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhauls, Load, and Time Windows) the most fitting variant.

Description: During emergencies, a humanitarian group delivers prefabricated shelters (<demand_linehaul>) to disaster zones (<loc_customer>). After the crisis subsides, they collect the shelters for redistribution. Deliveries are prioritized to ensure immediate aid, followed by pickups to recover materials. Vehicles must manage the weight of shelters (<capacity> ton) and any debris collected during retrieval. Routes terminate at the final pickup point, optimizing resource reuse and minimizing redundant travel.
Reason: The problem involves delivering prefabricated shelters (linehaul) and then collecting them for redistribution (backhaul), with the backhaul only occurring after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there is a capacity constraint for the weight of the shelters and any debris collected. The routes do not need to return to the depot as they terminate at the final pickup point, indicating an open route. There is no mention of distance limits or time windows, so these are not considered in the variant selection. The most specific variant that fits this description is VRPBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and an Open Route.

Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 74
Description: An outdoor adventure company delivers tents, sleeping bags, and camping gear to travelers (<loc_customer>) for weekend trips (linehaul) and later retrieves the gear post-adventure (backhaul). Each vehicle must first deliver the rented equipment (<demand_linehaul>) to pickup locations such as airports or campgrounds, then collect used gear (<demand_backhaul>) from return points like trailheads or drop-off zones. Routes must start at the central depot (<loc_depot>), prioritize deliveries before pickups, and conclude at the final return location. The goal is to minimize fuel costs while managing gear weight and space (<capacity>) across all stops.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles must first deliver the rented equipment (linehaul) and then collect used gear (backhaul), with the condition that deliveries are prioritized before pickups. This matches the "B" for backhaul demand which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands. The company also needs to manage gear weight and space, indicating a capacity constraint. However, since the backhaul feature is more specific than just capacity, we choose a variant that includes "B". There is no mention of distance limits ("L"), open routes ("O"), or time window constraints ("TW") in the given description.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 97
Description: A city’s seasonal bike-sharing program delivers bikes and gear to parks before peak hours (within strict delivery time windows). Returned equipment is later collected. Vehicles must first deliver rentals (linehaul) to park locations within time slots, then return to retrieve items (backhaul), managing capacity to avoid overloading. Timely service ensures equipment availability for users while optimizing routes for efficiency.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles must deliver (linehaul) and then later collect (backhaul) bikes and gear, ensuring that backhaul occurs only after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there are strict delivery time windows for both activities, which directly implies the need for time window constraints. The capacity of the vehicles is also a concern to avoid overloading, but since other features like "B" and "TW" are present, we prioritize them in our classification. The open route feature ("O") is not mentioned, as vehicles do return to a depot. Therefore, the most suitable variant is VRPBTW, capturing backhaul demand and time window constraints.

Description: In a flood-stricken region, aid organizations deliver emergency supplies like food and water (linehaul) to affected zones (<loc_customer>) within critical time windows (<time_windows>) to reach survivors promptly. Once the immediate crisis subsides, they collect hazardous waste and debris (backhaul) for safe disposal. Vehicles (<capacity>) start at the relief center (<loc_depot>), prioritize life-saving deliveries first, and conclude routes at the last pickup site. Time constraints ensure aid reaches victims before spoilage, while debris removal follows post-assessment schedules.
Reason: The problem description includes the need for delivering emergency supplies (linehaul) and collecting hazardous waste and debris (backhaul), with the condition that backhaul only occurs after linehaul. Additionally, there are time window constraints to ensure timely delivery of aid and post-assessment schedules for waste removal. The description does not mention distance limits for vehicles or open routes, where vehicles do not return to the depot. Given these details, the most specific variant that fits is VRPBTW, which accounts for backhaul operations following linehaul, under time window constraints.

Description: A design studio sends seasonal samples to `<num_customer>` boutique buyers (`<loc_customer>`) before a major trade show. Vehicles (capacity = `<capacity>` garments) depart from the studio (`<loc_depot>`), making deliveries and collecting returns (MB) from buyers who cannot attend. Each stop has tight time windows (`<time_windows>`) aligned with buyer availability. Couriers finish routes at the trade show venue (O) to assist with setup. Optimize for minimal travel time while ensuring fragile samples never exceed vehicle capacity.
Reason: The problem description mentions that vehicles have a specific capacity (`<capacity>` garments) and must adhere to tight time windows (`<time_windows>`) for each stop. Additionally, the problem includes mixed backhaul (MB) as it involves both deliveries (linehaul) and collections (backhaul) from buyers. The route is open-ended as the couriers finish their routes at the trade show venue (O), not returning to the depot. These characteristics align with the "VRPMBLTW" variant, which covers mixed backhaul, limited vehicle capacity, and time window constraints, in an open route setting.

Description: A telecommunications provider must rapidly deploy temporary cell towers to disaster-affected regions to restore connectivity. Each site has a critical time window for installation to meet urgent demands. After the crisis, towers must be retrieved and returned to the depot. Vehicles must first deliver equipment (linehaul) within setup time windows, then later collect the towers (backhaul), ensuring deliveries precede pickups. Route planning must respect vehicle capacities and strict timelines to avoid overloading while minimizing travel distance.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the vehicles must first deliver equipment (linehaul) and then later collect the towers (backhaul), with the condition that deliveries precede pickups. This fits the "B" backhaul criterion, where backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, the description specifies strict timelines and critical time windows for installation, which aligns with the "TW" time window constraints. There is no indication of open routes ("O") or distance limits ("L") in the description, and the presence of both linehaul and backhaul does not suggest simultaneous satisfaction ("MB"). Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.

Description: Telecom teams urgently deploy satellite dishes to disaster zones (<loc_customer>) and later retrieve outdated equipment. Vehicles (<capacity>) start from a depot (<loc_depot>), with strict time windows (<time_windows>) during safe weather. Deployments must occur before pickups to prioritize connectivity restoration. Distance limits (<distance_limit>) account for rugged terrain fuel use. Routes can end at the last site or depot after pickups, ensuring equipment returns for reuse without overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: (1) vehicles have a capacity for carrying satellite dishes and outdated equipment, (2) there are strict time windows during which the work must be done, (3) distance limits are considered due to rugged terrain, and (4) deployments (linehaul) must occur before pickups (backhaul), indicating a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after linehaul. Since the routes can end at the last site or return to the depot, this suggests a closed route. The presence of "B" (backhaul after linehaul), "L" (distance limit), and "TW" (time window) makes VRPBLTW the most suitable variant.

Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 80
Description: A medical logistics company must deliver diagnostic equipment to rural clinics and collect blood samples for testing. Each clinic has a time window during which staff are available for service. Deliveries (linehaul) of equipment must occur before pickups (backhaul) of samples to ensure proper testing. Vehicles have a strict capacity limit for both equipment and samples, cannot exceed a daily distance limit, and must end routes at the last clinic without returning to the depot. Time windows ensure samples are collected promptly and equipment is available for same-day use.
Reason: The problem description includes specific requirements such as the need for deliveries (linehaul) to occur before pickups (backhaul), strict vehicle capacity and distance limits, time windows for service, and the condition that routes end at the last clinic without returning to the depot. These features align with a scenario involving backhaul, linehaul, capacity, distance limits, and time windows, while also specifying an open route. The "VRPMBLTW" variant encompasses all these elements: mixed backhaul (MB) allowing for both linehaul and backhaul demands, limited vehicle capacities (C - although this is implicit in the presence of other attributes), daily distance constraints (L), and service within specified time windows (TW). Additionally, the requirement that vehicles do not return to the depot indicates an open route (O). However, since "O" variants are not necessary when other more specific qualifiers like MB, L, and TW are present, the most appropriate classification here is VRPMBLTW.

Description: A wholesale bakery supplies flour, sugar, and other ingredients to bakeries and collects empty delivery containers for reuse. Each truck has a capacity <capacity> and can visit bakeries in any order to drop off supplies (demand_linehaul) and pick up empty containers (demand_backhaul). The depot and 20 customer sites are located at <locs>. The challenge is optimizing routes so that ingredient deliveries and container pickups are efficiently combined without overloading trucks, ensuring bakeries have supplies while containers are recycled promptly.
Reason: The problem involves both delivering supplies (linehaul) and picking up empty containers (backhaul), with the backhaul only occurring after all linehaul demands are met. This matches the definition of "B" for backhaul. Additionally, there is a capacity constraint for the trucks, indicated by "<capacity>", which fits the "C" designation. Since there is no mention of open routes, distance limits, or time windows, the most specific variant that fits this scenario is VRPB, where B stands for backhaul and C (capacity) is implied but not explicitly denoted in the variant code as it is assumed when B, L, O, or TW are not present.

Description: A photography service provides equipment (cameras, lighting, tripods) to event venues for live coverage. Deliveries must be completed before pickups to ensure gear is available during the event. Each truck has a capacity limit to avoid overloading. Venues have setup time windows (before the event starts) and pickup deadlines after the event concludes. The challenge is to plan efficient routes that respect time windows and capacity, ending at the final pickup location without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem specifies that each truck has a capacity limit, venues have setup time windows and pickup deadlines (indicating time window constraints), and the routes are open (not returning to the depot after the final pickup). These characteristics align with an Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Capacity Constraints. The "O" stands for open routes, and "TW" indicates the presence of time windows. Since capacity is mentioned but not in conjunction with backhaul or mixed backhaul, and there is no mention of distance limits, the most fitting variant is OVRPTW.

Description: A public health agency needs to deliver medical testing kits, PPE, and signage to event venues (linehaul) ahead of large gatherings, with setup time windows aligned with crowd arrival times. After events, they must retrieve the equipment (backhaul) without returning to the depot. Vehicles must ensure deliveries precede pickups, stay within capacity, and adhere to strict time windows to avoid disrupting event operations.
Reason: The problem description specifies several key attributes: there are linehaul and backhaul operations, with the requirement that deliveries (linehaul) must precede pickups (backhaul). Additionally, there are strict time windows for both delivery and pickup to align with event schedules. The vehicles do not return to the depot after completing their tasks, indicating an open route. There is no explicit mention of vehicle capacity or distance limits being a primary concern, so these aspects are considered secondary. Given these details, the variant OVRPMBTW (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows) is the most specific match as it encompasses all the mentioned requirements.

Description: A construction firm dispatches trucks (capacity: `<capacity>`) from a storage yard (`<loc_depot>`) to deliver materials (e.g., cement `<demand_linehaul>`) to `<num_customer>` sites (`<loc_customer>`) and haul away debris (`<demand_backhaul>`). Routes must balance delivery/pickup order (e.g., drop off materials at Site X, collect debris from Site Y) without exceeding capacity or `<distance_limit>` (due to fuel constraints). Drivers finish at their last site.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the trucks have a capacity constraint, which is a characteristic of CVRP. However, it also specifies that the trucks must balance delivery and pickup (backhaul) orders without exceeding a distance limit, indicating both backhaul and limited distance constraints. The description does not mention time windows or that routes are open (i.e., drivers do not return to the depot). Therefore, the most specific variant that fits this description, considering the need for balancing linehaul and backhaul demands with distance limits, is VRPMBL.

Description: A government initiative provides schools with new laptops (linehaul) while collecting outdated devices (backhaul) for e-waste processing. Each school has a designated time window (TW) during school hours when staff can accept deliveries or hand over old equipment. Trucks start from an education hub (<loc_depot>), delivering laptops first, then retrieving old units. The vehicle capacity (<capacity>) must accommodate both outbound and inbound loads, with routes concluding at the final pickup location.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles must start from an education hub (depot) and return to a final pickup location, indicating a closed route. It also mentions that there are time windows during which schools can accept deliveries or hand over old equipment, and the vehicle capacity needs to accommodate both outbound (delivering new laptops) and inbound (collecting old devices) loads, suggesting mixed backhaul operations. Therefore, the most fitting variant is one that includes capacity, mixed backhaul, and time window constraints.

Description: A health organization operates mobile vaccination clinics to serve rural communities. Each clinic vehicle (capacity = `<capacity>` doses) starts at a central hub (`<loc_depot>`) and visits `<num_customer>` villages (`<loc_customer>`), each with a unique demand (`<demand>`) and strict time windows (`<time_windows>`) due to local events. Vehicles may deliver vaccines to some villages and collect blood samples from others in any order (MB). After the final stop, vehicles remain on-site for outreach (O). The goal is to maximize coverage while respecting cold-chain storage limits and appointment times.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: capacity (C), mixed backhaul (MB) for delivering vaccines and collecting blood samples, time window constraints (TW) due to local events, and an open route (O) since vehicles remain on-site for outreach after their final stop. Among the provided variants, OVRPMBLTW best captures all these features, including the presence of strict time windows, mixed backhaul operations, and the open nature of the routes.

Description: An online retailer must deliver new merchandise to customers while simultaneously collecting returned items for resell or recycling. Delivery trucks (with a <capacity> kg capacity) start at the warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering packages to <num_customer> locations (<loc_customer>) with specific order weights (<demand_linehaul>). After completing all deliveries, the same trucks must proceed to designated return points (backhaul customers) to collect returned goods (<demand_backhaul>). The route must ensure deliveries precede pickups to prevent overloading during the return phase. Additionally, each truck’s total travel distance must stay under a <distance_limit> km limit to avoid driver fatigue and ensure efficient fuel use. The goal is to minimize total distance while respecting capacity and distance constraints.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks have a capacity limit, a distance limit, and there is a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all deliveries (linehaul demands) are completed. There is no mention of an open route or time windows. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Linehaul where backhaul demand is satisfied only after linehaul, and there are also distance limits on the vehicles.

Trucks (capacity <capacity>) deliver specialized gear (<demand_linehaul>) while collecting unused props (<demand_backhaul>), with flexible stop order to accommodate shooting schedules. Routes are limited to <distance_limit> km due to union driver shift rules. Vehicles remain on-site after final delivery for next-day crew use.
Reason: The problem description indicates that trucks have a capacity limit, there are both linehaul (delivering specialized gear) and backhaul (collecting unused props) demands, and the routes are limited by a distance. Additionally, it is specified that vehicles remain on-site after the final delivery, implying an open route where the vehicle does not return to the depot. Since the backhaul can occur only after all linehaul demands are met, and given the presence of distance limits, the most fitting variant is VRPBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and Distance Limits.

Vehicles start at the brewery (<loc_depot>), first completing all keg deliveries (linehaul). They then collect empty kegs (backhaul) from the same or other locations. The truck’s capacity (<capacity>) restricts the combined weight of outgoing kegs and returned empties. Routes end at the final stop, minimizing redundant travel and adhering to weight limits.
Reason: The problem description mentions that vehicles first complete all keg deliveries (linehaul) before collecting empty kegs (backhaul), indicating a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands. Additionally, the truck’s capacity restricts the combined weight of outgoing and returned kegs, implying a capacity constraint. There is no mention of open routes, distance limits, or time window constraints, so the most fitting variant is VRPB.

Description: An automotive rental firm delivers leased vehicles (linehaul) to customers’ homes or offices by scheduled appointment times (TW). After the rental period ends, the same vehicles are picked up (backhaul) from return locations. Each truck can carry a limited number of vehicles (capacity), and routes must stay within a maximum daily distance to avoid driver fatigue and ensure timely pickups/drop-offs. The challenge is to coordinate delivery and return schedules, respect customer time windows, and optimize vehicle utilization without overextending drivers.
Reason: The problem description includes the need to deliver and pick up vehicles, indicating both linehaul and backhaul operations that can be satisfied simultaneously (MB). It also mentions a maximum daily distance for routes (L) and the requirement to meet scheduled appointment times (TW). The capacity of the trucks is noted, but this is included in most variants and does not uniquely define the variant. Since the scenario describes a closed route where vehicles return to the depot, "O" (open route) is not applicable. Therefore, the most fitting variant is VRPMBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Limited Distance, and Time Windows.

Each sensor has a calibration time window (<time_windows>) and requires <service_time> minutes for maintenance. Battery-powered service carts have limited range (<distance_limit>) and payload capacity (<capacity>). Teams conclude shifts at their last assignment.
Reason: The problem description includes a central facility (indicating closed routes, not open), replacement parts (linehaul demand), collection of faulty units (backhaul demand) with mixed sequencing allowed (MB), time windows for service (TW), and vehicles with limited range (L). The capacity constraint is also mentioned, but it is considered default in the presence of other features. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these conditions is VRPMBLTW.

Vehicles must first complete all deliveries before initiating pickups (B) and cannot exceed capacity (C) during either phase. Routes end at the final collection stop (O), optimizing fuel efficiency and reducing operational costs.
Reason: The problem description includes several key elements: the presence of time windows for both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) phases, a backhaul requirement that can only be initiated after all linehaul deliveries are completed, and capacity constraints. The routes end at the final collection stop, suggesting an open route structure since vehicles do not return to the depot.

Reason: The problem description mentions a few key attributes that help narrow down the specific variant. It includes linehaul (transporting food/supplies) and backhaul (collecting used rental gear), with the condition that vehicles have strict range limits due to avalanche risk zones, implying distance limits. Additionally, there's an emphasis on efficient interleaving of supply drops and equipment pickups, which suggests mixed backhaul. The need for operators to finish at their last assigned lodge before nightfall hints at time window constraints. Since the problem specifies both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, we focus on 'MB' variants. The presence of distance limits ('L') and time window constraints ('TW') further narrows it down to VRPMBLTW.

Description: A diagnostic lab dispatches mobile units from a central facility (`<loc_depot>`) to:  
1. Deliver medical supplies to clinics (`<demand_linehaul>`).  
2. Collect lab samples from the same clinics (`<demand_backhaul>`).  
Units (capacity: `<capacity>`) must adhere to:  
- **Time windows** (`<time_windows>`): Clinics have strict sample collection hours (e.g., 9–11 AM).  
- **Distance limits** (`<distance_limit>`): Units cannot exceed 200 km/day due to refrigeration limits.  
- **Mixed backhauls**: A unit might deliver supplies to Clinic A, then collect samples from Clinic B.  
*Goal*: Ensure all clinics are served within constraints while minimizing fleet size.
Reason: The problem involves delivering medical supplies (linehaul) and collecting lab samples (backhaul) simultaneously, which fits the "MB" (mixed backhaul) criterion. There are also time window constraints for sample collection, matching the "TW" requirement. Additionally, there is a distance limit per day for the mobile units, corresponding to the "L" feature. Since the problem specifies that all units start and end at a central facility, it does not fit the "O" (open route) category. Considering these specific requirements, the most fitting variant is VRPMBLTW, which includes mixed backhauls, time windows, and distance limits.

Description: Rangers in a national park distribute animal feed (<demand_linehaul>) to remote stations (<loc_customer>) while collecting confiscated traps and poaching evidence (<demand_backhaul>). Off-road vehicles (capacity <capacity>) start from a ranger post (<loc_depot>), with routes limited by fuel range (<distance_limit>). Deliveries and collections are sequenced based on real-time wildlife activity reports. Patrols end at their final station to maintain a presence in high-risk areas.
Reason: The problem involves distributing animal feed (linehaul demand) and collecting confiscated traps and poaching evidence (backhaul demand), with the condition that backhaul can only occur after linehaul is satisfied. Additionally, the off-road vehicles have a distance limit due to fuel range, and the routes are not required to return to the starting depot as they end at the final station. There are no explicit time window constraints mentioned.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 5
Description: A construction company needs to deliver building supplies to active job sites (<loc_customer>) and collect construction waste for recycling. Each truck (<capacity> ton capacity) starts at the central depot (<loc_depot>), first delivering materials to sites during their operational hours (time windows <time_windows>). After completing deliveries, trucks must return to the same route to pick up pre-sorted waste from the same sites. The challenge is to sequence routes so deliveries precede pickups, respect site-specific time windows, and avoid overloading trucks while ending tours at the final stop.
Reason: The problem description includes specific requirements for time windows (TW) during which deliveries and pickups must occur, a capacity constraint (C) for the trucks, and a backhaul condition (B) where waste is collected only after all deliveries are made. The variant VRPBTW best captures these aspects: it includes capacity constraints, backhaul demands that can only be satisfied after linehaul (delivery) demands, and time window constraints. The "O" (open route) and "L" (distance limit) attributes are not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement, so they are not included in the selection.

Description: After a major earthquake, emergency crews must distribute critical supplies (medical kits, generators) to isolated communities (<loc_customer>). Each community has a specific time window (<time_windows>) when rescue teams can safely access it due to aftershock risks or road clearances. Relief trucks departing from the regional command center (<loc_depot>) have a maximum load capacity of <capacity> tons. Routes must prioritize timely deliveries within windows while not overloading trucks, with crews halting at the last accessible site post-delivery.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each community has a specific time window when it can be accessed, and the relief trucks have a maximum load capacity. These conditions directly map to the "TW" (time window constraints) and "C" (capacity) attributes. Since "TW" is present, and there are no indications of backhaul, open routes, or distance limits, the most appropriate variant is VRPTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows).

Description: An agricultural equipment supplier must deliver tractors, harvesters, and irrigation systems from a regional depot (<loc_depot>) to <num_customer> farms. Each farm’s order (<demand> ton) varies based on size and crop type. Delivery trucks are limited to a <capacity> ton load due to road weight restrictions. The company must design routes that cover all farms while respecting truck capacities, ensuring timely delivery without violating legal weight limits on rural roads.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each delivery truck is limited to a certain capacity (capacity constraint, C) and must respect legal weight limits on rural roads, which implies distance or route constraints. However, there is no mention of backhaul demand (B), open routes (O), mixed backhaul (MB), or specific time window constraints (TW). The most fitting variant, considering the capacity and implied distance limitations, is VRPL, where L stands for the vehicles having distance limits.

Description: A healthcare provider rents specialized medical devices (e.g., wheelchairs, monitors) to patients and schedules pickups after their recovery. Delivery trucks (<capacity> devices) must first deliver equipment to patients’ homes (<time_windows>) before returning to collect devices from others. Each route is restricted to a 7-hour duration (<duration_limit>), and vehicles must not exceed their capacity during combined delivery and pickup loads. The solution must balance urgency of deliveries with efficient backhaul scheduling.
Reason: The problem description indicates several key attributes: there are capacity constraints for the delivery trucks, time windows for both deliveries and pickups, a 7-hour duration limit for each route, and a need to balance backhaul (pickup) and linehaul (delivery) operations. The most fitting variant is VRPMBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Load Capacity, and Time Windows. This variant captures all the mentioned constraints, including the mixed backhaul requirement, where both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, along with the capacity and time window constraints.

Description: An airport’s ground crew needs to redistribute luggage carts, baggage tugs, and other equipment between terminals (<loc_customer>) based on fluctuating flight schedules. Each terminal has a service window (<time_windows>) when equipment is needed (e.g., during peak arrivals). Forklift trucks (<capacity> tons) transport equipment but cannot exceed a daily distance limit (<distance_limit> km) due to battery life constraints. Routes originate from the equipment depot (<loc_depot>), ending at the final terminal to avoid unnecessary return trips. The goal is to ensure all terminals receive their required equipment (<demand>) within time windows while preventing vehicle overload and excessive travel.
Reason: The problem involves redistributing equipment with specific demands at different terminals, which must be done within certain time windows. The vehicles (forklift trucks) have a capacity limit and cannot exceed a daily distance limit. Additionally, the routes do not require returning to the depot, making it an open route. These characteristics match the 'OVRPBLTW' variant, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, Distance Limit, and Time Windows.

Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 80
Description: A wind farm operator must send maintenance crews to service offshore turbines. Each turbine requires a specific set of tools and crew members (<demand>), and can only be accessed during tidal windows (<time_windows>). Maintenance vessels (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a coastal depot (<loc_depot>), must return before depleting fuel (<distance_limit> km), and must prioritize urgent repairs. Routes must ensure all turbines are serviced within their operational windows while avoiding excessive travel for crews.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: the capacity of the maintenance vessels, distance limits due to fuel constraints, and time window constraints for accessing turbines. There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, and it is implied that all routes are closed (return to depot) since the vessels must return to a coastal depot. The presence of capacity, distance limits, and time windows points to the VRPLTW variant, where L stands for distance limits, and TW for time window constraints. Since the capacity constraint is less specific in this context given the presence of other features, it does not affect the final classification.

Description: A touring festival organizer must set up stages at remote forest venues. Each site (<loc_customer>) has a setup time window (<time_windows>) before audience arrival. Flatbed trucks (<capacity> cubic meters) transport oversized equipment from a central storage facility (<loc_depot>). The trucks must complete deliveries before their fuel runs out (<distance_limit> km), as fuel stations are scarce in the wilderness. Routes must optimize travel paths to meet all deadlines without exceeding vehicle capacity or range limits.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the flatbed trucks have a distance limit before their fuel runs out, indicating "L" (distance limits) is a critical feature. Additionally, there are setup time windows for each site, which aligns with the "TW" (time window constraints) feature. The capacity of the trucks and the need to optimize travel paths without exceeding vehicle capacity also suggest the presence of "C" (capacity), but since "L" and "TW" are more specific, they take precedence in the classification. There is no mention of backhaul ("B" or "MB") or open routes ("O"), so these are not considered. Therefore, the most appropriate variant that fits all specified conditions is VRPLTW.

Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile testing units that both administer COVID-19 tests at community sites (<loc_customer>) and collect completed test kits for lab processing. Vehicles with <capacity> specimen capacity depart from a central lab (<loc_depot>), performing tests (deliveries) and pickups in flexible sequences. Each route must complete within <distance_limit> km due to sample viability constraints, with vehicles remaining at their final location for next-day operations.
Reason: The problem description mentions that vehicles have a specimen capacity, which aligns with the "C" (capacity) feature. Additionally, it specifies a distance limit for each route due to sample viability constraints, which matches the "L" (distance limits) feature. There is no mention of backhaul demands, mixed backhauls, or time windows, and the routes do not need to return to the depot at the end of the day as the vehicles remain at their final location for next-day operations, indicating an "O" (open route) characteristic. Therefore, combining these features, the most specific variant that fits this scenario is OVRPL.

Description: A sports logistics firm manages equipment delivery for marathons, tournaments, and competitions. Gear like water stations, cones, and signage must be delivered to venues before event start times (linehaul with strict time windows). Post-event, all equipment is retrieved (backhaul). Capacity constraints on trucks require careful load planning, while time windows ensure setup is completed before athlete arrivals and teardown occurs after events conclude.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: strict time windows for delivery and pickup, capacity constraints on trucks, and the need to handle both linehaul (delivery before events) and backhaul (retrieval after events). The most specific variant that captures these aspects is VRPMBTW. This variant accounts for mixed backhaul (both linehaul and backhaul can be satisfied simultaneously), and it also includes time window constraints which are crucial for ensuring that deliveries and pickups occur within specified time frames.

Vessels alternate between delivering feed sacks (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieving harvested crates (<demand_backhaul>), ending routes at the last farm serviced. Maximum route distances of <distance_limit> nautical miles are enforced for fuel safety in open waters.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the boats (vehicles) have a capacity constraint, and they alternate between delivering feed sacks (linehaul) and retrieving harvested crates (backhaul). It also mentions that backhaul demand can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is met. Additionally, there are distance limits for the routes due to fuel safety concerns. Since the problem does not mention any time window constraints or indicate that the routes are open (i.e., vehicles do not return to the depot), the most fitting variant is VRPBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and limited distances.

1) Restock products (<demand_linehaul>) during morning hours (<time_windows>) before offices open  
2) Collect cash payments (<demand_backhaul>) after lunch peaks  
3) Perform emergency maintenance (service_time) at malfunctioning units  
Machines in high-security buildings have narrow service windows, requiring precise scheduling that interleaves restocking and collection tasks without exceeding vehicle weight limits.
Reason: The problem description includes several key elements: the need to manage vehicle capacity, the presence of both linehaul (restocking) and backhaul (cash collection) demands with specific rules about when each can occur, time windows for servicing, and no mention of open routes or distance limits. The requirement that restocking must happen before cash collection ("backhaul demand which can be satisfied only when all the linehual demand is satisfied") points towards a "B" classification. Additionally, there are strict time window constraints for service, indicating a "TW" component. Given these requirements, VRPBTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows) seems the most fitting, as it accounts for the need to satisfy all linehaul demands before backhaul and adheres to specified time windows, without needing an open route or vehicle distance limits.

Description: A gas supplier manages cylinder logistics for <num_customer> factories (<loc_customer>). Trucks (<capacity> cylinder limit) from the plant (<loc_depot>) deliver full cylinders (<demand_linehaul>) and collect empties (<demand_backhaul>) in flexible sequences. Routes cannot exceed <distance_limit> km due to hazardous material transport regulations. The solution must prevent mid-route capacity violations (e.g., carrying too many full+empty cylinders simultaneously) while minimizing fleet mileage.
Reason: The problem involves a vehicle routing scenario where trucks have a cylinder capacity limit, need to deliver full cylinders (linehaul) and collect empty ones (backhaul), with the condition that routes cannot exceed a certain distance. This matches closely with VRPBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and Linehauls, and includes a distance limit (L). There is no mention of time windows or open routes, so variants including "TW" or "O" are not applicable. The backhaul can only be satisfied after linehaul, which aligns with the "B" classification rather than "MB".

Installation teams have fixed time windows (<time_windows>) at each location based on customer availability, and each service takes a predetermined time (<service_time>). Routes must be completed within driver shift limits (<time_limit>). The objective is to minimize operational costs while meeting all scheduling commitments.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks have limited cargo space, indicating a capacity constraint (C). It also mentions that each stop can involve either delivering new furniture (linehaul) or collecting expired rentals (backhaul), with both types of operations being allowed in mixed sequencing, which aligns with the mixed backhaul (MB) characteristic. Additionally, there are fixed time windows for installation teams at each location, pointing to the presence of time window constraints (TW). The need to complete routes within driver shift limits and minimizing operational costs while meeting all scheduling commitments further supports the inclusion of time windows.

Vehicles must arrive during each clinic’s operating hours (time windows), with supplies unloaded first. Capacity constraints include refrigerated space for perishable medications and dry storage for samples. Routes must return to the depot within a 200km limit to ensure samples are processed within 24 hours.
Reason: The problem description includes several key elements: 1) The need for both linehaul (delivering medical supplies) and backhaul (collecting blood samples), with the condition that supplies are unloaded first, suggesting a mixed backhaul scenario (MB). 2) There are specific time windows during which vehicles must arrive at each clinic (TW). 3) Vehicles have capacity constraints for different types of goods, including refrigerated space (C, though this is subsumed by the MB feature). 4) A distance limit of 200km to ensure timely processing of samples (L).

Description: A manufacturing supplier delivers raw materials to factories (linehaul) and collects scrap metal from them (backhaul). Factories require deliveries during daytime shifts (time windows) and allow pickups only after production hours end. Trucks must prioritize deliveries to meet production schedules, then collect scrap without exceeding their <capacity> ton limit. Routes end at the final customer site to avoid unnecessary return trips.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (scrap collection) operations with the condition that backhaul can only be done after all deliveries are completed, indicating a "B" for backhaul. There are also time window constraints for deliveries and pickups, which means the "TW" (time windows) attribute is applicable. The problem does not mention distance limits for vehicles, nor does it specify an open route, meaning vehicles return to a depot or final customer site. Additionally, there is a capacity constraint for the trucks, but this is implied by the presence of other specific attributes like B and TW, making the explicit "C" unnecessary in the classification.

Each vessel has a <capacity> ton limit and must stay within a <distance_limit> km travel range to ensure safe navigation. Routes are open-ended, ending at the last station visited, with samples collected only after all deliveries are completed. This balances logistical efficiency with environmental safety.
Reason: The problem description mentions a capacity limit, a distance limit, and that the backhaul (collecting samples) only occurs after all deliveries (linehaul) are completed. Additionally, the routes are open-ended, meaning the vessels do not return to the depot. These characteristics align with the "OVRPB" variant, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, where backhaul demand can be satisfied only after all linehaul demands are met, and the routes are open.

Each delivery requires a specific number of perishable items (<demand>), and customers expect their orders within designated time windows (<time_windows>) to ensure freshness. Delivery vans have limited capacity (<capacity>) to prevent overcrowding, and routes must not exceed <distance_limit> to avoid delays that risk spoilage. Drivers begin at the kitchen, follow optimized paths to drop off kits, and finish at their last delivery location. The challenge is to balance efficiency, freshness, and compliance with all constraints to maximize customer satisfaction.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each delivery has a specific demand, the vehicles have a limited capacity, there are distance limits for the routes, and customers expect their orders within designated time windows. These constraints align with the VRP variant that includes capacity (C), distance limits (L), and time window (TW) constraints.

A fleet of trucks (<capacity>) transports projectors, screens, and sound systems from a storage facility (<loc_depot>). Each truck’s route must not exceed a maximum distance (<distance_limit>), as they are electric vehicles with limited range. The goal is to schedule deliveries so all equipment arrives at venues within their time windows, without overloading trucks or forcing drivers to return to the depot after their final drop-off.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks have a maximum distance limit, indicating the "L" (distance limits) attribute. It also mentions strict setup deadlines, which implies the presence of "TW" (time window constraints). There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, nor is there any indication that the routes are open, meaning the vehicles must return to the depot after completing their deliveries.

Each location’s service time (<service_time>) accounts for customer interactions. Vehicles (<capacity> kg capacity) must carry both new meters and empty containers for old devices, ensuring no overloading. Routes terminate at the final meter site, reducing idle return travel.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (installing new meters) and backhaul (collecting old meters) operations, where the backhaul can only occur after the linehaul. Additionally, there are specific time windows for service to avoid inconveniencing residents, and vehicles have a capacity constraint to carry both new and old meters.

Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles have strict capacity limits, a distance limit for the routes, and involves both linehaul (delivering water) and backhaul (collecting solar panels) activities. Since the trucks do not return to the depot after their last service, this indicates an open route. The scenario does not mention any specific time windows for servicing. Given these conditions, the most appropriate variant is one that accounts for mixed backhaul, vehicle capacity, distance limitations, and an open route without time window constraints.

Description: A service provider circulates high-end amenities (linens, toiletries) to luxury hotels (<demand_linehaul>) while collecting used items for laundering (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have temperature-controlled compartments (<capacity>) and must adhere to hotels' strict delivery windows (<time_windows>) to avoid disrupting guest services. The MB flexibility enables routes like: deliver fresh towels to Hotel X → pick up dirty linens from Hotel Y → drop off new robes at Hotel Z.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhaul (MB) operations, where the service provider delivers new items and picks up used ones simultaneously. It also mentions that the vehicles have capacity constraints for temperature-controlled compartments and must adhere to strict delivery windows (TW). The description does not specify open routes or distance limits, nor does it imply that backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Therefore, the most fitting variant is VRPMBTW, which covers mixed backhaul, capacity, and time window constraints.

Description: A fleet of mobile electric vehicle (EV) charging trucks operates across a city, providing on-demand charging services to stranded EVs while simultaneously collecting battery health data. Each truck starts at a central hub (<loc_depot>) with a limited battery supply (<capacity> kWh). Customers (<loc_customer>) request charging (<demand_linehaul>) or battery diagnostics (<demand_backhaul>), with service time windows (<time_windows>) based on driver availability. Trucks can sequence charging and diagnostics in any order (MB) and end their shift at their final location (O). The goal is to minimize total operational costs while ensuring no truck exceeds its energy capacity and all appointments are met within their time windows.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features: trucks have a limited battery capacity, there are time windows for service, and the ability to perform both charging (linehaul) and diagnostics (backhaul) simultaneously. Additionally, the final location of the trucks can be different from the starting depot, indicating an open route. These characteristics align with the OVRPMBLTW variant, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Linehaul, Time Windows, and Limited Capacity.

Description: A luxury hotel chain requires daily deliveries of spa supplies (oils, towels, and treatments) to satellite locations, followed by the collection of soiled linens and used supplies. Trucks (<capacity> kg) must first deliver fresh inventory during morning <time_window> hours when spas open, then collect waste during evening shifts. Each stop has a mandatory <service_time> for inventory checks, and routes must terminate at the final pickup location to minimize fuel costs.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks have a capacity limit, there are time window constraints for deliveries and collections, and the route involves both delivering fresh inventory (linehaul) and collecting waste (backhaul). Since the collection (backhaul) happens after all deliveries (linehaul) are completed, this indicates a backhaul condition. Additionally, the requirement to terminate routes at the final pickup location to minimize fuel costs suggests closed routes, not open ones. The presence of service times and mandatory stops does not directly correspond to a variant but is considered in the context of time windows. Therefore, the most fitting variant from the list, considering the need for capacity, backhaul, and time windows, is VRPBTW.

Description: Medical laboratories need to deliver specialized diagnostic equipment to remote clinics (linehaul) and collect blood or tissue samples (backhaul) for analysis. Each sample has a strict time window (<time_windows>) to preserve viability, requiring precise scheduling. Trucks (capacity <capacity>) must first deliver equipment before proceeding to pickup sites, as samples cannot wait in a loaded vehicle. Routes conclude at the lab’s processing facility, not the origin depot, to streamline sample analysis. The goal is to minimize delays while adhering to capacity limits and ensuring all stops are serviced within their critical timeframes.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks must first deliver specialized diagnostic equipment (linehaul) and then collect blood or tissue samples (backhaul), with the backhaul only occurring after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there are strict time windows for sample collection to ensure viability, indicating a need for precise scheduling within these constraints. The routes do not return to the origin depot but conclude at the lab’s processing facility, which suggests an open route. There is no mention of distance limits for the vehicles, so the "L" feature is not applicable. Given these conditions, the variant VRPBLTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, and Time Windows) best fits the scenario, except that the open route aspect should be considered, leading us to OVRPBLTW (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, and Time Windows).

Description: A healthcare supplier delivers critical medications to clinics and hospitals (<loc_customer>), then collects expired drugs and medical waste for disposal. Each healthcare facility has strict time windows for deliveries (to align with staff shifts) and pickups (to comply with hazardous material regulations). Trucks must prioritize deliveries before waste collection, never exceeding their capacity (<capacity> kg). Routes terminate at the last stop to minimize turnaround time and ensure timely waste removal.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks must prioritize deliveries before waste collection, indicating a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after the linehaul (delivery) demand is met. Additionally, there are strict time windows for both deliveries and pickups at healthcare facilities. The capacity of the trucks is also a constraint. Since the route terminates at the last stop, it implies an open route structure where vehicles do not return to the depot. These features best match the VRPMBTW variant, which includes mixed backhaul (MB), time window constraints (TW), and implicitly considers capacity (C).

Description: A film production company must deliver cameras, lighting rigs, and props to remote filming locations (linehaul) within tight time windows dictated by actor availability and scene schedules. After filming concludes, equipment must be retrieved (backhaul) without returning to the central depot. Vehicles must optimize routes to avoid overloading while ensuring deliveries occur before pickups to meet production deadlines.
Reason: The problem description includes the need for delivering and retrieving equipment (linehaul and backhaul), not returning to the central depot after completion (open route), and adhering to strict time windows. The capacity constraint is implied but is secondary to these more specific requirements. The mixed backhaul requirement is also noted, as both deliveries and pickups can happen during the route. Thus, the most fitting variant from the list that covers open routes, mixed backhaul, and time window constraints is OVRPMBTW.

Description: A company supplies temporary power generators to construction sites and event venues. Vehicles depart from a central depot (<loc_depot>) to first deliver generators (linehaul) to customers (<loc_customer>). After delivery, they collect used fuel containers (backhaul) from the same or other locations. The truck’s capacity (<capacity>) limits the combined weight of generators and returned fuel. Routes must prioritize deliveries before pickups and conclude at the final stop, optimizing fuel efficiency and reducing empty return mileage.
Reason: The problem description includes a central depot, which means the routes are not open (excludes "O" variants). It specifies that the truck’s capacity limits the combined weight of generators and returned fuel, indicating a capacity constraint. The requirement to prioritize deliveries before pickups points towards a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands, fitting the "B" attribute. There is no mention of distance limits or time window constraints, so "L" and "TW" are not applicable. Given these conditions, the most appropriate variant is VRPB, capturing the essential aspects of capacity and backhaul with priority on linehaul.

Each refrigerated truck can carry <capacity> kg of vaccines and waste, with a <distance_limit> km restriction to prevent battery drain. Drivers conclude routes at the last waste collection site to avoid unnecessary return trips.
Reason: The problem involves both delivering vaccines (linehaul) and collecting used syringes and vials (backhaul), indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. The delivery of vaccines and collection of medical waste are subject to time window constraints, and the vehicles have a distance limit. Additionally, the drivers conclude their routes at the last waste collection site, which suggests an open route where vehicles do not return to the depot. These features best match with the VRPMBLTW variant, signifying a Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Time Windows, and Limited Distance.

Routes must accommodate mixed sequences (e.g., deliver to Restaurant A → collect waste from Restaurant B → deliver to Restaurant C) while respecting perishability time constraints. Vehicles end routes at final delivery points.
Reason: The problem description mentions that trucks deliver harvested greens (linehaul) and simultaneously collect food waste for composting (backhaul) from the same locations, indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, there are strict delivery windows for meal prep hours, which translates to time window constraints. The variant VRPMBTW best captures these characteristics: mixed backhaul (MB) and time window (TW) constraints.

Description: A construction logistics firm supplies heavy machinery and materials (linehaul) to active job sites and retrieves scrap metal (backhaul) for recycling. Deliveries must precede pickups to avoid blocking site access. Vehicles are constrained by weight capacity (<capacity>) for both equipment and scrap. Construction sites have time windows (<time_windows>) tied to shift schedules, while distance limits (<distance_limit>) ensure drivers return before fuel exhaustion. Routes must balance equipment delivery deadlines with scrap collection efficiency, avoiding detours that exceed operational ranges.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: capacity constraints, backhaul (scrap metal collection) that can only occur after linehaul (equipment delivery), distance limits for vehicles, and time windows for construction sites. Given these elements, the variant VRPMBLTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Limited Distance, and Time Windows) is the most specific and appropriate choice. It captures all the mentioned constraints: mixed backhaul to allow simultaneous handling of both types of demands under certain conditions, limited distance to account for the operational range, and time windows to match the site access and shift schedules.

Description: A events company sets up decorative structures at venues (linehaul) and removes them afterward (backhaul). Venues specify setup and teardown time windows (e.g., setup must finish by 4 PM, removal starts at 11 PM). Trucks must first deliver and install decorations, then return to the same locations later to collect materials. Each truck’s <capacity> cubic meters must accommodate both outbound setups and inbound removals, with routes concluding at the last teardown site.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks must deliver and install decorations (linehaul) and then return to the same locations later to collect materials (backhaul). It also mentions that each truck has a capacity limit, and there are specific time windows for setup and teardown. The key features here are backhaul (B), mixed backhaul (MB) since both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, and time window constraints (TW). Since the routes conclude at the last teardown site, it implies that the vehicles do not need to return to a depot, suggesting an open route (O). Considering all these elements, the most appropriate variant is OVRPMBTW.

Description: A movie studio coordinates trucks (<capacity>) to transport filming equipment (<demand_linehaul>) to shooting locations (<loc_customer>) and retrieve used props (<demand_backhaul>). Time windows (<time_windows>) align with tight shooting schedules (e.g., "Camera A must arrive between 5:30–6:00 AM for sunrise scene"). Mixed routing allows delivering lights to Location X before picking up costumes from nearby Location Y. Service times (<service_time>) include equipment setup/breakdown. Overloading trucks risks damaging expensive gear.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple key attributes: there is a capacity constraint for the trucks, a demand for both linehaul (transporting filming equipment) and backhaul (retrieving used props), mixed routing that allows for delivering and picking up items in the same trip, and strict time window constraints due to tight shooting schedules. The variant VRPMBLTW best captures all these aspects: "M" for mixed backhaul, "B" for backhaul, "L" for distance limits which can be interpreted as the need to not overload trucks to avoid damaging the gear, and "TW" for the time window constraints.

After the pop-up closes, the same vehicles collect unsold items and empty containers (<demand_backhaul>). Deliveries must occur before pickups to ensure proper load sequencing. The routes prioritize minimizing travel distance, with trucks concluding their tours at the final pickup site.
Reason: The problem description indicates that trucks start at a distribution center (loc_depot) and deliver goods to pop-up stores (demand_linehaul), then collect unsold items and empty containers (demand_backhaul) after the stores close. The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, which matches the "B" (backhaul) characteristic. Additionally, the routes aim to minimize travel distance, but there is no mention of specific distance limits for the vehicles, nor any open route or time window constraints.

Trucks with a <capacity> kg limit must first complete all deliveries to ensure freshness, then proceed to vineyards for waste pickup. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius of the central warehouse (<loc_depot>) to maintain refrigeration for perishable items and reduce emissions. The winery aims to optimize fuel costs and logistical efficiency while adhering to strict capacity and distance restrictions.
Reason: The problem description includes linehaul (delivering wine bottles) and backhaul (collecting grape pomace) operations, with the condition that all deliveries must be completed before any backhaul can occur. Additionally, there are capacity constraints for the trucks and a distance limit for the routes to ensure refrigeration and reduce emissions.

Furthermore, each truck’s route cannot exceed a <distance_limit> km limit to comply with flight crew schedules and avoid overnight travel. The depot (<loc_depot>) coordinates routes to minimize total distance while ensuring all parts are delivered and retrieved without violating constraints.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each truck has a capacity limit, there are backhaul demands which can only be satisfied after linehaul demands (indicating a strict sequence), and there is a distance limit for each route. The depot coordinates the routes to ensure all parts are delivered and retrieved, indicating a closed route (not open). There is no mention of time window constraints.

Description: A waste management company delivers empty recycling bins to residential areas (<loc_customer>) and collects filled containers afterward. Residents have designated time windows for bin delivery (e.g., weekends) and pickup (e.g., weekday mornings). Trucks (<capacity> bins per load) must first distribute empty bins before collecting filled ones, ensuring no overloading. Routes end at the last collection point, optimizing resource allocation for urban sustainability initiatives.
Reason: The problem description includes specific time windows for both the delivery of empty bins and the collection of filled ones, which matches the "TW" (time window constraints) attribute. Additionally, the requirement to distribute empty bins before collecting filled ones suggests a backhaul situation, but since it is specified that this must be done in sequence (not simultaneously), the "B" (backhaul demand) attribute is more fitting than "MB" (mixed backhaul). The capacity constraint of the trucks ("C") is also mentioned, but according to the instructions, if other features like "TW" or "B" are present, we do not specifically denote "C". There is no indication of open routes or vehicle distance limits, thus variants with "O" or "L" are not considered. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBTW.

Some stops require collecting previous kits (backhaul) while others only need deliveries, with sequence flexibility. Drivers work maximum 5-hour shifts (<duration_limit>) to ensure kit quality. The challenge is to coordinate this mixed delivery/pickup operation while respecting time constraints and vehicle capacities.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each van carries fragile exhibits with a capacity limit, must arrive during school hours (time windows), and involves both deliveries and pickups with some flexibility in the sequence (mixed backhaul). Additionally, there is a maximum 5-hour shift duration for drivers, which can be considered as a time window constraint rather than a strict distance limit. The requirement for vans to return to the museum after completing their tasks indicates that this is not an open route. Therefore, the most fitting variant is VRPMBTW, which accounts for mixed backhaul and time window constraints.

Time windows are critical: late deliveries risk event disruptions, while early pickups may violate venue agreements. Vehicles have capacity (<capacity>) constraints to balance the weight of outbound equipment and inbound returns, ensuring efficient routing and compliance with venue schedules.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints for deliveries and pickups, which are critical to the operation. Additionally, it mentions that vehicles have capacity constraints for both outbound (deploying) and inbound (collecting) equipment, indicating a mixed backhaul situation. The need to return to collect equipment after the event suggests that this is not an open route. There is no mention of distance limits for the vehicles. Therefore, the most specific variant that fits this scenario is VRPMBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows.

Each snowmobile has a weight limit (<capacity>) and a battery-dependent range (<distance_limit>). Routes must prioritize sample preservation by allowing flexible pickup/delivery orders and ending at the last camp to conserve energy.
Reason: The problem involves transporting sensor equipment (linehaul) and retrieving ice core samples (backhaul), with a condition that the backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Each snowmobile has a weight limit (capacity) and a battery-dependent range (distance limit). The requirement to end at the last camp indicates an open route, meaning the vehicles do not need to return to the depot. There is no mention of time window constraints.

Description: A pharmaceutical company delivers critical medications to rural clinics (<loc_customer>) and collects expired drugs for safe disposal (backhaul). Vehicles from the medical depot (<loc_depot>) must prioritize deliveries before pickups, maintaining a <capacity> kg payload limit. Routes are restricted to <distance_limit> km to comply with refrigeration constraints for perishable supplies, ending at the final clinic. The goal is to maximize efficiency without compromising drug integrity or disposal regulations.
Reason: The problem description mentions a capacity limit for the vehicles, backhaul (collecting expired drugs after deliveries), and a distance limit to comply with refrigeration constraints. The sequence of operations (deliveries before pickups) and the specific nature of the backhaul indicate that this is not a mixed backhaul scenario but rather one where backhaul can only occur after all linehaul demands are met. There is no mention of time windows or open routes, so the most fitting variant from the list, considering these constraints, is VRPBL.

Description: A security firm deploys barriers, cameras, and monitoring systems to venues hosting high-profile events. Trucks (<capacity> kg) must deliver equipment ahead of event start times (<time_window>), then retrieve gear immediately after the event concludes. Delivery routes prioritize venues with earlier start times, while pickups follow strict post-event schedules to avoid congestion. The <service_time> includes setup and takedown coordination with event staff, ensuring all equipment is secured before departing for the final stop.
Reason: The problem description includes the need for trucks with a specific capacity to deliver and then pick up equipment, indicating a backhaul scenario. Additionally, there are strict time window constraints for both delivery (prior to event start times) and pickup (immediately after events conclude). The service also involves setup and takedown coordination, which implies a fixed or variable service time at each location. Given these requirements, the most fitting variant is VRPMBTW, as it encompasses mixed backhaul (both linehaul and backhaul can be satisfied simultaneously) and time window constraints.

Description: A race organizer must deliver water stations, first-aid kits, and directional signage to checkpoints along a marathon route (<loc_customer>). All equipment originates from a logistics hub (<loc_depot>). Each checkpoint has unique supply needs (<demand>), and delivery trucks cannot exceed their weight and space limits (<capacity>). The goal is to route vehicles efficiently to avoid overloading, cover all checkpoints, and allow drivers to conclude their routes at the final drop-off point.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks have weight and space limits, which indicates a capacity constraint. Additionally, it mentions the need to route vehicles efficiently to cover all checkpoints, but does not specify distance limits for the vehicles, backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, or time windows. Since no other specific attributes (O, B, L, TW) are mentioned, and the primary concern is the capacity of the vehicles, the most appropriate variant is CVRP, where C stands for capacity.

Description: A ski resort needs to distribute skis, snowboards, and safety gear to mountain lodges (linehaul) before opening hours. After the day’s activities, the resort collects the equipment for maintenance (backhaul). Each lodge has time windows for morning setup and evening pickup. Vehicles must first deliver gear to all locations, then return along the route to collect items, without overloading their capacity (<capacity>). Routes must be planned to avoid delays during peak traffic and ensure the last pickup location is the route’s endpoint.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key aspects: 1) There are capacity constraints for the vehicles, 2) The process involves both linehaul (delivering gear to lodges) and backhaul (collecting gear from lodges), with the backhaul only occurring after all deliveries have been made, indicating a strict order of operations that fits the "B" (backhaul) characteristic, and 3) Each lodge has specific time windows for delivery and pickup, which aligns with the "TW" (time window) constraint. The requirement for vehicles to return to the depot is implied by the need to collect items for maintenance, ruling out "O" (open route) variants. Given these details, the most appropriate variant is VRPBTW, as it encompasses backhaul requirements and time window constraints, while also implicitly considering vehicle capacity.

Description: A telecom provider must deploy satellite hotspots to remote areas for an event and retrieve them post-event. Deployment must occur within the event’s start time window, while retrieval is scheduled after its conclusion. Trucks (<capacity> capacity) first deliver the equipment and later collect it, ensuring capacity constraints are met. Routes must align with connectivity deadlines to avoid service gaps, prioritizing efficiency and adherence to strict timelines.
Reason: The problem description mentions capacity constraints for the trucks, which aligns with the 'C' (capacity) feature. Additionally, there are strict time window requirements for both deployment and retrieval, which matches the 'TW' (time window) feature. The scenario also involves a backhaul process, where the same vehicles that deliver the equipment later collect it, but this is not dependent on the completion of all linehaul demands, thus better fitting the 'MB' (mixed backhaul) characteristic. Given these features, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBTW.

Description: Following a widespread power outage, a utility company dispatches generators (linehaul) to critical infrastructure sites like hospitals and shelters. Each delivery must occur within a time window to meet urgent demand. Once grid repairs are complete, generators are collected (backhaul) for redistribution. Vehicles must deliver supplies first, then collect equipment, without exceeding capacity limits. Routes conclude at the final pickup location, and time windows ensure timely restoration of services, while service times account for on-site coordination delays.
Reason: The problem description includes several key elements: the need for both linehaul (delivering generators) and backhaul (collecting generators) operations, capacity constraints on vehicles, and time window constraints for deliveries and pickups. The scenario also specifies that once grid repairs are complete, the generators are collected for redistribution, implying a backhaul operation that occurs after all linehaul demands are met. However, there is no explicit mention of distance limits or open routes where vehicles do not return to the depot. Given these details, the most fitting variant is VRPBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows.

Description: A retail chain’s warehouse (<loc_depot>) must restock <num_customer> stores with new inventory (linehaul) while collecting returned items (backhaul). Stores operate within specific hours (<time_window>), and returns must be picked up after deliveries to avoid storage conflicts. Trucks have a <capacity> cubic meter limit, and routes are constrained by a <distance_limit> km maximum to ensure same-day returns. The challenge is synchronizing deliveries and pickups to maximize vehicle utilization while minimizing detours and delays.
Reason: <Error> at parse json

However, given the specific mention of needing to synchronize deliveries and pickups, and that returns are picked up after deliveries, this points more directly towards a backhaul (B) requirement where backhaul occurs only after linehaul is completed, rather than a mixed backhaul situation. Additionally, there's no indication that the routes are open (O), meaning all vehicles start and end at the depot.

Description: A sports federation needs to deliver goalposts, scoreboards, and safety equipment from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>) to stadiums hosting national championship events (<loc_customer>, etc.). Each venue’s equipment requirements (<demand>) depend on the sport. Delivery vans cannot exceed their capacity (<capacity> cubic meters) to accommodate bulky items. Routes must end at the final venue, reducing transportation costs.
Reason: The problem specifies that delivery vans cannot exceed their capacity, which is a key feature of the CVRP. Additionally, there is no mention of backhaul, distance limits, open routes, or time windows in the description. The requirement to minimize transportation costs by ending routes at the final venue does not specifically indicate an "open" route in the traditional sense of OVRP, as it still involves planning efficient routes from the depot. Thus, the most fitting variant is CVRP, which focuses on vehicle capacity constraints.

Description: A catering company deploys food trucks from a commissary (<loc_depot>) to multiple festival locations (<loc_customer>). Each truck has limited ingredient capacity (<capacity>) and must complete its route before perishables expire (<time_limit>). Stops involve both delivering fresh supplies to satellite vendors (linehaul) and collecting unsold food for composting (backhaul), with flexible sequencing. Each festival location has strict vendor access windows (<time_windows>) and unloading takes variable time (<service_time>). The goal is to maximize freshness while minimizing fuel costs across all routes.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: capacity (C), backhaul and linehaul demands that can be satisfied simultaneously (MB), time windows for service at each location (TW), and a time limit for perishables, which implies a form of distance or time constraint but is not explicitly a return to depot requirement (L is not strictly applicable as it refers to distance limits, and O is not applicable as vehicles do need to return to the commissary). Given these elements, VRPMBLTW is the most specific variant that encompasses all described features.

Description: A foodservice supplier delivers cooking oil, spices, and kitchenware to restaurants while collecting used cooking oil for biodiesel production. The trucks (capacity <capacity>) begin at the central warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering fresh supplies to multiple eateries. After completing all deliveries, the same vehicles collect the used oil from the same locations. This ensures that the vehicle’s capacity is not exceeded during deliveries and that hazardous materials are handled safely in the return phase. The aim is to optimize routes for minimal fuel costs and environmental impact.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the trucks first deliver fresh supplies (linehaul) and then, after completing all deliveries, collect used cooking oil (backhaul). This indicates a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied once all linehaul demands are met. There is also a mention of the truck’s capacity and an aim to optimize routes for minimal fuel costs and environmental impact, but no explicit indication of open routes, distance limits, or time window constraints. Therefore, the most fitting variant is VRPB, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul.

Description: A recycling company must deliver new packaging materials to businesses (linehaul) and collect recyclables from the same locations (backhaul). Each business has strict operating hours (time windows) during which deliveries and pickups must occur. Trucks must deliver supplies first before collecting recyclables to avoid contamination. With a capacity limit of <capacity> kg, routes must balance outbound and inbound loads while ensuring no vehicle returns to the depot after completing all stops.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks must deliver supplies (linehaul) first before collecting recyclables (backhaul), which aligns with the "B" backhaul feature. Additionally, there are strict operating hours (time windows) for deliveries and pickups, fitting the "TW" time window constraints. The capacity limit of the trucks is also mentioned, but since other specific features ("B", "TW") are present, the "C" capacity constraint is implicitly covered. There is no mention of distance limits or open routes, so "L" and "O" do not apply. Given these conditions, VRPBTW is the most appropriate variant.

Description: A film festival organizer must deploy high-value projectors to theaters for screenings and securely collect them afterward. Each theater has specific time windows for setup (delivery) and teardown (pickup). Delivery trucks (<capacity> capacity) must deliver projectors before screenings start and retrieve them immediately after, ensuring no truck exceeds its capacity. The challenge is coordinating routes to meet all venue time windows while optimizing fuel costs and safeguarding equipment.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks have a capacity constraint, and there are specific time windows for setup (delivery) and teardown (pickup) at each theater. The requirement to optimize fuel costs suggests an interest in efficient routing, but the primary constraints mentioned are the capacity of the trucks and the strict time windows for service. There is no mention of backhaul, open routes, or distance limits, which leads us to select the variant that accounts for capacity and time window constraints.

Description: Solar farm inspection crews in a sprawling desert require tools, safety gear, and replacement parts to evaluate panels and equipment. Trucks start from a depot (<loc_depot>), carrying limited capacity (<capacity> kg) to distribute supplies to inspection sites (<loc_customer>). Each site demands specific items (<demand> kg), and routes must not exceed <distance_limit> km to prevent crews from getting stranded. Vehicles end their routes at the last site, ensuring efficient use of resources and compliance with distance restrictions.
Reason: The problem description mentions that trucks start from a depot, carry limited capacity to distribute supplies, and routes must not exceed a certain distance. This indicates the presence of both capacity ("C") and distance limits ("L"). There is no mention of backhaul, mixed backhaul, or time windows, and the routes do end at the last site, but there is no explicit statement about open routes where vehicles do not return to the depot.

Each customer specifies a time window (<time_windows>) for service, such as morning delivery and afternoon pickup. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius to ensure timely completion. The challenge is to balance speed with capacity constraints while avoiding depot returns.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features: vehicles have a capacity limit, there is both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups), and each customer specifies a time window for service. Additionally, the routes are limited by a distance constraint.

After finishing all deliveries, the same trucks collect compost bins filled with organic waste (backhaul demand: <demand_backhaul> kg) from the same or nearby stops. The route must prioritize deliveries before pickups to prevent spoilage of groceries or contamination of compost loads. Trucks conclude their route at the final compost pickup point.
Reason: The problem description indicates that there are both linehaul (delivering groceries) and backhaul (collecting compost) demands, with the specific requirement that all deliveries must be completed before starting pickups. This matches the "B" for backhaul demand, which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met. Additionally, since the trucks have a capacity limit in kg, this also fits the "C" for capacity. However, given the presence of "B", we prioritize it over "C". There is no mention of distance limits ("L"), open routes ("O"), or time window constraints ("TW") in the description, so these are not included in the variant selection.

Description: Healthcare distributors must deliver medical supplies (e.g., vaccines, syringes) to rural clinics (linehaul) and collect biohazardous waste (e.g., contaminated needles, expired medications) for safe disposal (backhaul). Each truck’s capacity (<capacity> liters) must accommodate both sterile supplies and hazardous materials without cross-contamination. Routes must be shorter than <distance_limit> km to ensure timely returns for restocking and compliance with health regulations.
Reason: The problem description indicates that there are both linehaul (delivering medical supplies) and backhaul (collecting biohazardous waste) demands, which must be handled simultaneously without requiring one to be completed before the other. This matches the "MB" or Mixed Backhaul criteria. Additionally, the presence of a distance limit for the routes (<distance_limit> km) aligns with the "L" attribute, indicating a maximum travel distance. There is no mention of time window constraints, nor an indication that the vehicles do not return to the depot, so the "TW" and "O" attributes do not apply. The capacity constraint is present but is considered default when other specific features like MB and L are mentioned, hence the "C" is not separately needed in the variant.

Trucks start at the depot (<loc_depot>), delivering new meters (linehaul) to homes (<loc_customer>) before collecting the old meters (backhaul) for recycling. Each vehicle can carry up to <capacity> meters and must complete all deliveries before pickups. Routes must not exceed <distance_limit> km to ensure technicians can finish within a single shift. The provider aims to minimize total travel distance while ensuring efficient meter replacement and e-waste collection, with trucks terminating at the last stop.
Reason: The problem specifies that each vehicle has a capacity limit for carrying meters, must complete all deliveries (linehaul) before pickups (backhaul), and routes must not exceed a certain distance. There is no mention of open routes or time windows. The condition that backhauls can only be performed after all linehauls are completed aligns with the "B" variant, and the presence of a distance limit for each route corresponds to the "L" variant. Since the "C" (capacity) constraint is also present but is implied by other constraints, it is not explicitly needed in the classification.

Trucks (capacity <capacity>) originate from a relief hub (<loc_depot>), deliver supplies first, then haul debris. Routes must end at waste disposal sites and stay within <distance_limit> km to avoid fuel shortages in disrupted road networks.
Reason: The problem involves trucks with a capacity limit (C), linehaul demand for delivering emergency kits, and backhaul demand for collecting hazardous debris. The description specifies that backhaul can only occur after linehaul, which aligns with the "B" (backhaul) characteristic where backhaul demand is satisfied only after all linehaul demand. Additionally, there is a distance limit for the routes, fitting the "L" (distance limits) feature. There are no indications of open routes or time windows, thus excluding "O" and "TW".

The depot and 20 restaurant locations are at <locs>, with delivery demands <demand_linehaul> and waste pickup requirements <demand_backhaul>. The goal is to plan routes that balance load efficiency and minimize travel costs while ensuring all customers are serviced.
Reason: The problem involves deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) with a capacity constraint for the trucks. The backhaul demand (collecting used cooking oil and food waste) can be satisfied only after all linehaul demands (deliveries of fresh ingredients and supplies) are met, which is characteristic of the "B" (backhaul) feature. There is no mention of open routes, distance limits, or time window constraints, so we do not include "O", "L", or "TW" in our classification.

Later, they collect waste (backhaul) after kitchen staff finish preparing meals. Each truck has a capacity (<capacity>) for both supplies and waste bins. Routes must stay within a distance limit (<distance_limit>) to ensure timely deliveries and pickups. Drivers end their routes at the last restaurant to streamline logistics for multiple daily runs.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features: trucks have a capacity for both supplies and waste bins, there are distance limits for the routes, and specific time windows for deliveries and pickups. Additionally, the backhaul (collecting waste) can only occur after all linehaul (delivering supplies) is completed, indicating a backhaul demand that follows linehaul.

After completing deliveries, the same trucks must return to collect filled containers (<demand_backhaul>), ensuring pickup quantities don’t exceed truck capacity (<capacity>). Each business has strict time windows (<time_windows>) for service—deliveries must occur during business hours, while pickups are scheduled after waste accumulation peaks. The goal is to minimize fuel costs while respecting capacity limits and timing constraints, ensuring no truck violates sequence rules or time windows.
Reason: The problem description includes specific capacity demands for both delivering empty containers (linehaul) and collecting filled ones (backhaul), with the backhaul demand only being satisfied after all linehaul deliveries are completed. It also mentions strict time windows for service at each business, and the need to minimize fuel costs, which implies considering the distance limits, although this is not explicitly stated. Since there is no mention of an open route (vehicles do not return to the depot), the most fitting variant that captures these characteristics (capacity, backhaul, and time windows) is VRPBLTW.

Sites enforce time windows (<time_windows>) for noise-sensitive areas. Trucks may finish at disposal facilities after debris pickups.
Reason: The problem description mentions capacity constraints, backhaul and linehaul demands where backhaul can only be done after linehaul, distance limits for vehicles, and time windows for deliveries. Since the problem includes all these features, but does not explicitly mention that the routes are open (i.e., trucks do not need to return to the depot), the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, and Time Windows, as well as distance limits.

Reason: The problem description specifies several key features: (1) There are time windows for setup at each station, which matches the "TW" (time window constraints) attribute. (2) The requirement to deliver gear (linehaul) and then later collect items (backhaul), with the condition that deliveries must come first, aligns with the "B" (backhaul) feature, as it implies that backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. (3) There is no mention of vehicles not returning to a depot, so the "O" (open route) variant does not apply. (4) The problem also mentions balancing capacity limits, but since this is a common feature in VRP and we have more specific attributes like "B" and "TW", the "C" (capacity) prefix is not needed. (5) Distance limits on the vehicles are not explicitly mentioned, so the "L" (distance limit) is not included. Combining these, the most fitting variant is "VRPBTW".

Description: After a major earthquake, a telecom provider urgently deploys portable communication towers to isolated regions. Each tower requires specific equipment (<demand>) that must fit within truck capacities (C). Vehicles depart from a disaster response hub (<loc_depot>) and end at the final installation site (O). Routes must stay within distance limits (L) to ensure fuel sufficiency. Critical time windows (TW) are enforced to restore connectivity before nightfall, as darkness halts installation work.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles have distance limits (L) and must adhere to critical time windows (TW) for service. There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demand, nor does it specify that the routes are open, meaning the vehicles do not return to the depot. Therefore, the most fitting variant includes capacity (C), distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW).

Description: A tech company circulates laptops and peripherals among regional offices. Service vans (<capacity> devices) start at a refurbishment center (<loc_depot>), delivering upgraded devices to offices (<loc_customer>) during their IT department hours (<time_windows>), while collecting outdated equipment (backhaul) in any sequence. The mixed backhaul approach enables adaptive routing based on real-time inventory needs. Vehicles park overnight at their last visited office.
Reason: The problem description mentions a capacity constraint for the service vans, time windows for delivery based on IT department hours, and a mixed backhaul approach allowing for both delivery of new devices and collection of outdated ones. Additionally, it specifies that vehicles do not return to the depot but park overnight at their last visited office, indicating an open route. These features best match the VRPMBLTW variant which includes mixed backhaul (MB), time window constraints (TW), and is an open route (O) without needing to explicitly state O in the variant as all other qualifiers are present.

Description: A modular construction company transports pre-fabricated building units to construction sites (linehaul) for assembly. After installation, they retrieve any unused or leftover units (backhaul) for reuse on other projects. Deliveries must precede pickups to ensure construction timelines are met. Routes end at the final pickup location, with vehicle capacities (<capacity>) ensuring safe transport during both phases.
Reason: The problem description specifies that deliveries (linehaul) must precede pickups (backhaul), and there are vehicle capacity constraints. It also mentions the need to adhere to construction timelines, which can be interpreted as time window constraints. The scenario does not indicate that vehicles have distance limits or that routes are open (not returning to the depot). Therefore, the most suitable variant is VRPBTW, which includes backhaul and time window constraints.

Description: A gas supplier manages cylinder exchanges for factories (`<loc_customer>`). Trucks (capacity: `<capacity>`) depart from a plant (`<loc_depot>`), delivering full cylinders (`<demand_linehaul>`) and collecting empties (`<demand_backhaul>`). Mixed sequencing allows drivers to swap cylinders at each stop (e.g., deliver first, then pick up, or vice versa). Routes minimize distance, and trucks stay at the last factory for next-day collections.
Reason: The problem description mentions that trucks have a capacity, which is covered by the "C" attribute. It also specifies that the trucks deliver full cylinders and collect empties, and this can be done in any order at each stop, which matches the "MB" (mixed backhaul) feature. There is no mention of time windows, vehicle distance limits, or open routes, so we do not include "TW", "L", or "O" attributes. The basic VRP with mixed backhaul and capacity constraints best fits the scenario described.

Each vessel at <loc_customer> has a scheduled arrival window <time_window> and requires <demand> tons of supplies. Supply ships starting from the coastal base at <loc_depot> have a capacity of <capacity> tons and must complete their routes within <distance_limit> nautical miles. Due to the vessels’ fixed schedules, ships cannot return to port after their final delivery but must ensure all resupply stops are completed within the vessels’ operational windows.

Description: A university’s logistics team delivers chemical supplies and equipment to research labs and collects hazardous waste for disposal. Labs specify time windows for receiving materials (to align with experiments) and a separate window for waste pickup. Deliveries must precede pickups to ensure safety protocols are followed. Vehicles have limited capacity to handle both supply deliveries and waste collection, and routes end at the final waste collection site to optimize fuel and time.
Reason: The problem description specifies that deliveries (linehaul) must precede pickups (backhaul), and both operations have specific time windows for service. Additionally, there are capacity constraints for the vehicles. The route ends at the final waste collection site, indicating an open route. Therefore, the most suitable variant is OVRPMBTW, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows, fitting all these criteria.

Description: A healthcare provider sends vans to deliver medical equipment and vaccines (linehaul) to remote clinics and collects blood samples or diagnostic specimens (backhaul) for laboratory analysis. Each van has a limited capacity to accommodate both supplies and perishable biological materials. Deliveries must arrive before clinics’ operational hours end (time windows), and pickups follow to ensure samples are retrieved promptly. Routes are restricted by distance limits to avoid delays in rural areas with poor infrastructure. The objective is to balance load constraints, time windows, and route feasibility to maximize service efficiency.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each van has a limited capacity (C), there are both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) happening simultaneously (MB), the routes have distance limits (L), and there are specific time windows for deliveries and pickups (TW). Since the vehicles need to return to the depot after completing their tasks, this rules out the "O" variants. The "B" variant is not suitable as it implies backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand, which contradicts the given scenario. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBLTW, which covers mixed backhaul, distance limits, and time window constraints.

Description: A medical rental service delivers mobility aids like wheelchairs to patients’ homes (linehaul) by their scheduled therapy times (TW) and collects them after use (backhaul). Each delivery and pickup has time windows based on patient availability. Vehicles must carry both equipment and returned items within capacity limits. The objective is optimized routes for timely service and efficient capacity use.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering mobility aids) and backhaul (collecting them after use) with the ability to satisfy both demands simultaneously, which aligns with the "MB" (Mixed Backhaul) characteristic. Additionally, each delivery and pickup has time windows based on patient availability, indicating the presence of "TW" (Time Window) constraints. The objective also mentions capacity limits, but since we already have more specific attributes ("MB" and "TW"), we do not need to explicitly add "C" (Capacity).

Description: Health authorities deploy mobile clinics to various urban locations for seasonal health fairs. Each clinic requires specific medical supplies (e.g., vaccines, diagnostic kits) with weight limits (C). Vehicles depart from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>) but do not return after their final drop-off (O). Routes must stay within a maximum travel distance (L) to ensure drivers can complete their shifts within working hours. Clinics must be operational by specific time windows (TW) to align with public schedules, requiring precise timing to avoid delays or early arrivals.
Reason: The problem description specifies that vehicles do not return to the depot after their final drop-off (O), there are maximum travel distance constraints (L), and clinics must be operational within specific time windows (TW). These features align with the OVRPBLTW variant, which includes open routes (O), vehicle distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW). The backhaul (B) feature is not explicitly mentioned, but since the presence of 'O', 'L', and 'TW' is clearly stated, OVRPBLTW is the most fitting variant.

Description: A festival organizer deploys stages and lighting (<demand_linehaul>) to event venues and later collects recyclables (<demand_backhaul>). Delivery trucks (<capacity> tons) prioritize setup before waste collection. Routes cover <distance_limit> km spans, ending at the final venue to streamline logistics.
Reason: The problem description mentions that delivery trucks have a capacity (tons) and that there are distance limits for the routes. Additionally, it specifies that the trucks prioritize setup (linehaul) before waste collection (backhaul), indicating a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Since the problem does not mention any time window constraints or open routes, the most fitting variant is VRPBL which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Linehaul under Distance Limits.

Description: A city deploys technician teams to calibrate temporary traffic sensors before major events. Vans (capacity <capacity> sensors) start at the DOT yard (<loc_depot>), delivering new sensors (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieving expired ones (<demand_backhaul>) at intersections (<loc_customer>). Calibration must occur during low-traffic windows (<time_windows>). Routes respect daily overtime limits (<time_limit> hours), with vans parked near last job sites.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key attributes: capacity of the vans, linehaul (delivering new sensors), backhaul (retrieving expired ones) that can be done only after all linehaul demands are satisfied, time windows for calibration, and daily overtime limits. The 'O' (open route) is not mentioned, so it's not included. Therefore, the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and Time Windows, considering the capacity is already implied and not a distinguishing factor when other features like B, L, and TW are present.

Description: A city’s waste management team must distribute empty recycling bins to residential areas (<loc_customer>) and collect filled bins from commercial zones (backhaul). Trucks starting at the central depot (<loc_depot>) must first deliver bins before retrieving waste, adhering to a <capacity> ton limit to prevent overloading. Routes cannot exceed <distance_limit> km to ensure timely operations, with drivers concluding their day at the last stop. The challenge is balancing delivery and pickup sequences while optimizing fuel use and reducing traffic congestion.
Reason: The problem description includes the need for trucks to deliver empty recycling bins (linehaul) and then collect filled bins (backhaul), with the backhaul only happening after all deliveries are made. This matches the 'B' (backhaul) feature. Additionally, there is a <distance_limit> for the routes, indicating that the vehicles have distance limits, which corresponds to the 'L' (distance limit) feature. The capacity constraint is also present but is ignored in the presence of other features. There's no mention of open routes or time windows, so 'O' and 'TW' are not applicable. Therefore, the most specific variant that fits this description is VRPBL.

Description: Mobile healthcare units need to be equipped with medical supplies before serving remote villages. A central warehouse (<loc_depot>) dispatches vans to each unit (<loc_customer>), each requiring a specific supply bundle (<demand>). Vans have a limited carrying capacity of <capacity> kg. Routes must end at the final unit’s location to avoid detours, ensuring timely deployment and no overloaded vehicles.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the vans have a limited carrying capacity of <capacity> kg, which is a key feature of the CVRP (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem). There are no indications of backhaul demands, distance limits for the vehicles, open routes, or time window constraints in the given description. The primary focus is on the capacity constraint and ensuring that the vans can deliver the required medical supplies without being overloaded, which aligns with the CVRP variant.

Each delivery must arrive within strict *time windows (TW)* to avoid experiment delays. Vehicles are *capacity (C)* restricted by equipment size and fragility, while routes must adhere to *distance limits (L)* to prevent overheating or vibration damage during transit.
Reason: The user's problem description includes the need for time windows (TW) to ensure deliveries arrive within a specific timeframe, capacity (C) restrictions due to equipment size and fragility, and distance limits (L) to prevent damage during transit. There is no mention of backhaul demands or open routes. The most specific variant that encompasses these constraints is VRPBLTW.

Description: An IT services company must deploy mobile Wi-Fi hotspots to various festival venues (<loc_customer>) from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>). Each truck carries equipment (<capacity> units) and has 6-hour deployment windows (<time_windows>) before events begin. Technicians both install routers (linehaul) and later retrieve them (backhaul), with operations potentially mixed at multi-day events. Vehicles cannot exceed 200km daily routes (<distance_limit>) due to maintenance requirements. The goal is to service all venues while optimizing equipment transfers and minimizing fleet mileage.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: capacity (C), mixed backhaul operations where both installation and retrieval can happen simultaneously (MB), distance limits for the vehicles (L), and time window constraints (TW). The "O" attribute, which indicates open routes, is not mentioned, as the trucks are described as returning to a central warehouse. Given these features, the most specific variant that matches the provided description is VRPMBLTW.

Description: A company organizes temporary pop-up events at multiple locations (<loc_customer>) across the city. They need to deliver event equipment like tents and stages (linehaul) to each site before the event starts, adhering to strict setup deadlines (<time_windows>). After the event concludes, they must collect the equipment (backhaul) for reuse. Vehicles depart from the central warehouse (<loc_depot>), must not exceed their carrying capacity (<capacity>), and complete their routes ending at the final pickup point. Deliveries must precede pickups to ensure setups are complete before teardown begins, all while respecting the time windows for both phases.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles must deliver equipment (linehaul) and then collect it (backhaul) after the event, ensuring that deliveries are completed before pickups. Additionally, there are strict time windows for setup and teardown, and the vehicles have a carrying capacity. The variant VRPMBTW includes mixed backhaul (allowing for both linehaul and backhaul simultaneously, but in this case, respecting the sequence), time window constraints, and implicitly covers the capacity aspect, making it the most fitting choice.

Description: A rental company provides temporary equipment (e.g., stages, tents) to event venues and retrieves them post-event. Deliveries must precede pickups, as equipment cannot be collected until it’s first delivered. Vehicles have limited capacity to handle both deliveries and pickups. Routes must also respect distance limits to ensure the truck can return to the depot without excessive travel, optimizing fuel and operational costs.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles have limited capacity for handling both deliveries and pickups, which implies a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, it specifies that there are distance limits to ensure the truck can return to the depot, optimizing fuel and operational costs. There is no mention of time windows or open routes, so these constraints are not included. The most fitting variant under these conditions is VRPMBL, as it covers mixed backhaul (MB) and distance limits (L).

Boats have load limits (<capacity>) and must access sites during tidal windows (<time_windows>). Daily routes cannot exceed <distance_limit> nautical miles for safety. Vessels remain at the last site for overnight monitoring.
Reason: The problem description includes linehaul and backhaul demands, with the condition that old units (backhaul) are retrieved after deploying new ones (linehaul), indicating a "B" feature. Additionally, there are capacity constraints on the boats, time windows for accessing sites, and a daily distance limit. Since the boats do not return to the depot but stay at the last site, this indicates an "O" (open route) characteristic. The presence of all these features points towards the OVRPBLTW variant, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls, Linehauls, Time Windows, and Distance Limits.

Factories impose strict time windows (<time_windows>) for deliveries to synchronize with production schedules. Routes must also respect a maximum duration (<time_limit>) to ensure driver shifts comply with labor laws. The aim is to reduce idle time at factories while optimizing fuel costs.
Reason: The problem description includes vehicle capacity constraints, backhaul demand that can be satisfied only after linehaul demand is met, and strict time windows for deliveries.

Each clinic has a time window (<time_windows>) based on staff availability. Units may alternate between testing and vaccination stops (mixed sequencing) and remain at their last location for subsequent missions. The goal is to maximize daily coverage while respecting cold-chain storage limits and appointment schedules.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple key attributes: the mobile units have a capacity, they handle both linehaul (delivering vaccines) and backhaul (administering tests) demands with mixed sequencing, and each clinic has a time window for service. The presence of mixed backhaul (MB), and time windows (TW) are the most specific features mentioned. There is no explicit mention of open routes or distance limits, and since the vehicles start and end at the depot, it is not an open route variant.

Description: A national park authority deploys vehicles to deliver trail repair materials (linehaul) to remote mountain trails and collect litter and hazardous waste (backhaul). Each vehicle’s capacity (<capacity>) is limited by rugged terrain and vehicle size. Routes are restricted to (<distance_limit>) kilometers to ensure drivers can return safely before darkness. Vehicles finish their routes at the final waste collection point, avoiding depot return to prioritize urgent trail restoration.
Reason: The problem description mentions that vehicles have a limited capacity, are subject to distance limits, and perform both linehaul (delivering materials) and backhaul (collecting waste) tasks. Additionally, the routes do not return to the depot but end at the final waste collection point, which indicates an open route. The specific requirement for the backhaul demand to be satisfied only after all linehaul demands is met suggests a backhaul constraint. However, since the task specifies that backhaul and linehaul can be managed in the same trip, "MB" (mixed backhaul) is more appropriate than just "B". Time window constraints are not explicitly mentioned, so "TW" is not included. Considering these factors, the most fitting variant is OVRPMBL, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Distance Limits.

Due to fuel and operational safety constraints, each vessel’s round-trip journey must not exceed <distance_limit> nautical miles. Each turbine requires specific quantities of parts. Plan routes to service all turbines without exceeding capacity or distance limits, minimizing total travel distance.
Reason: The problem description mentions a central harbor depot, indicating that the routes are not open (no "O").

The goal is to minimize total travel distance while ensuring all equipment is delivered on time and collected post-production without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery vehicles must prioritize deliveries (linehaul) before pickups (backhaul), indicating a backhaul feature. It also mentions strict time windows for setup at each location, which corresponds to the time window constraints. Additionally, there are capacity limits and a maximum route distance, but these are covered by the more specific features of backhaul and time windows.

Each day, they must deliver heavy machinery (e.g., excavators, generators) to job sites (<loc_customer>) requiring equipment (<demand_linehaul>), and simultaneously collect returned tools from other clients (<demand_backhaul>). Trucks have a strict weight capacity (<capacity>), and safety regulations require that all deliveries are completed before pickups can begin. The goal is to plan routes that ensure every job site receives its equipment without overloading trucks, while efficiently scheduling pickups afterward—ending each route at the final drop-off or pickup location to avoid unnecessary return trips.
Reason: The problem specifies that the company must deliver equipment to job sites and then collect returned tools, with the requirement that all deliveries (linehaul) are completed before pickups (backhaul) can begin. This matches the "B" backhaul demand condition. Additionally, there is a strict weight capacity for the trucks, which aligns with the "C" capacity constraint.

However, it is also noted that the backhaul (collection) can only happen after the linehaul (delivery and setup) is completed, which aligns with the "B" (backhaul) characteristic rather than "MB" (mixed backhaul). Additionally, there are time window constraints ("TW") for both the setup and collection phases to ensure they align with crew availability and do not delay cleanup. The problem does not mention open routes or distance limits on vehicles, so "O" and "L" are not applicable. Since "C" (capacity) is a general feature and the more specific features "B" and "TW" are present, we prioritize those over "C".

Description: A pharmacy’s delivery fleet transports prescription medications to patients’ homes and collects used medical supplies (e.g., syringes) for safe disposal. Each vehicle’s capacity limits require careful coordination between outbound deliveries and inbound pickups. Since stops can be ordered freely, routes might first drop off prescriptions to suburban areas before picking up waste from urban centers, or vice versa. The system must ensure no vehicle overloads while maximizing route efficiency.

Description: An adventure tour company deploys kayaks and camping gear (<demand_linehaul> kg) to remote lakes (<loc_customer>) for morning tours (<time_windows>). After游客 return, trucks collect used gear (<demand_backhaul>) for sterilization. Vehicles (<capacity>) must complete deliveries by 7 AM and pickups by 5 PM, with total route distance under <distance_limit> km to access rugged terrain. Gear pickups strictly follow deliveries to avoid cross-contamination in vans. Routes conclude at the final recovery site to reduce fuel waste.
Reason: The problem description includes several key elements: vehicles with a capacity limit, time windows for deliveries (by 7 AM) and pickups (by 5 PM), backhaul demand that follows linehaul demand, and distance limits. The need to conclude routes at the final recovery site rather than returning to the depot suggests an open route. However, given the specific condition that backhaul only occurs after all linehaul is completed, this aligns more closely with "B" (backhaul) than "MB" (mixed backhaul). Thus, combining these attributes, the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW, which accounts for backhaul, limited distances, and time windows.

Description: A tech firm deploys new servers and networking gear to corporate clients (linehaul) while retrieving obsolete equipment for recycling (backhaul). Clients mandate strict service windows (<time_windows>) to avoid disrupting IT operations. Vehicles must first deliver hardware to ensure minimal downtime, then collect e-waste without exceeding weight limits (<capacity>). Routes finalize at the last client location, with collected e-waste later consolidated by separate recycling trucks.
Reason: The problem description indicates the presence of both linehaul (delivering new hardware) and backhaul (collecting obsolete equipment) operations, with a condition that all linehaul demand must be satisfied before backhaul can occur. Additionally, there are strict service windows (time window constraints) to adhere to, and a capacity limit for the collected e-waste. Since the routes finalize at the last client location, this suggests an open route where vehicles do not return to the depot. However, the "O" prefix is typically used for problems where the start and end points are different and not necessarily returning to a depot, which is not strictly specified here. The key elements matching our criteria are backhaul after linehaul ("B") and time window constraints ("TW"). Capacity is also a factor but is included by default unless other attributes like B, L, or TW are present. Distance limits ("L") are not mentioned. Therefore, VRPBTW is the most appropriate variant.

Description: A construction equipment rental firm delivers machinery (e.g., drills, generators) to job sites and collects returned tools at the end of projects. Vehicles (<capacity>) depart from a central depot (<loc_depot>), first delivering equipment to active sites (<loc_customer>), then retrieving idle tools from completed sites. Routes must adhere to a strict distance limit (<distance_limit>) to minimize fuel costs and ensure drivers return before daylight ends. The capacity constraint mandates that delivery and pickup loads do not exceed the vehicle’s weight or space limits.
Reason: The problem description mentions a strict distance limit for the routes, which corresponds to the "L" (distance limits) attribute. It also specifies that there are both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) of equipment, but does not indicate that backhauls can only occur after all linehauls are completed, nor does it suggest that the two types of demands cannot be satisfied simultaneously, which would lean towards an "MB" (mixed backhaul) classification. The capacity constraint is mentioned, but as per the instructions, this is represented by "C" and is ignored when other features like "L" or "MB" are present. There is no mention of time windows or open routes, ruling out "TW" and "O". Thus, considering the presence of distance limits and mixed backhaul operations, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBL.

Each unit starts at a central hub (<loc_depot>), visits multiple solar installations (<loc_customer>) to perform cleaning (delivering cleaning fluid <demand_linehaul>) while collecting damaged panels for recycling (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have limited cleaning fluid capacity (<capacity>) and maximum daily operating range (<distance_limit>). Technicians finish their day at the last site without returning to base.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles start at a central hub, visit multiple sites, and do not return to the base at the end of the day, which aligns with the "O" (open route) attribute. Additionally, the cleaning units have limited cleaning fluid capacity ("C") and maximum daily operating range ("L"). The task involves delivering cleaning fluid (linehaul demand) and collecting damaged panels for recycling (backhaul demand), where backhaul can only be satisfied after linehaul, indicating a "B" (backhaul) requirement. There is no mention of time windows, so "TW" is not included. Given these characteristics, the most fitting variant is OVRPBL, as it encompasses all the specified constraints without adding unnecessary features like mixed backhaul or time windows.

The challenge is coordinating with event schedules to minimize downtime and storage costs. The depot and 20 event venues are at <locs>, with delivery demands <demand_linehaul> and pickup demands <demand_backhaul>.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles must first deliver equipment (linehaul) to venues before collecting it (backhaul), and only after all linehaul demands are met can backhaul demands be satisfied, which aligns with the "B" feature. Additionally, there is a mention of coordinating with event schedules, implying time window constraints for deliveries and pickups, fitting the "TW" characteristic. The capacity constraint is also mentioned but is less specific compared to the other features, so we do not choose "C". There is no indication of open routes or distance limits, thus excluding "O" and "L" variants. Given these considerations, VRPBTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and Time Windows) seems to be the most appropriate variant.

Description: A network of electric vehicle (EV) battery swap stations requires daily replenishment of charged batteries and collection of depleted ones. Trucks depart from a central depot (<loc_depot>) to deliver fresh batteries to stations (<loc_customer>) while also collecting used batteries for recycling. Each truck has a maximum capacity (<capacity>) for battery storage and must complete deliveries before pickups (B). Stations operate within strict time windows (<time_windows>) to align with peak EV traffic periods, requiring precise scheduling (TW). Routes must not exceed a daily distance limit (<distance_limit>) to prevent overworking drivers, and vehicles end their tours at their final stop (O). The goal is to optimize routes to meet all stations’ demands (<demand>) without overloading trucks or missing time constraints while minimizing total travel distance.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks must deliver fresh batteries before collecting used ones (B), operate within strict time windows (TW), and not exceed a daily distance limit (L). Additionally, the description mentions that the vehicles end their tours at their final stop, which does not necessarily imply an open route (O) but rather a closed one.

Vehicles conclude routes at the last store, avoiding depot returns. The challenge is to balance crate flows efficiently while adhering to vehicle limits and reducing total travel distance.
Reason: The problem involves an open route (vehicles conclude routes at the last store, avoiding depot returns), backhaul demand (collecting used crates) that can be served only after all linehaul demand (delivering clean crates) is satisfied, and a need to balance crate flows while adhering to vehicle limits and reducing total travel distance.

Description: An agricultural logistics firm delivers farming equipment (tractors, harvesters) to rural farms (linehaul) and collects harvested crops (backhaul) for processing. Vehicles must deliver machinery before the harvest window (time constraints) and then collect crops immediately after. Each truck has a capacity limit for both equipment and crop loads. Routes are restricted by distance to ensure accessibility in remote areas. The challenge is to synchronize deliveries and pickups, ensuring farmers can begin harvesting promptly and crops are retrieved before spoilage, while respecting operational limits.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the agricultural logistics firm must deliver farming equipment (linehaul) and then collect harvested crops (backhaul) immediately after, indicating a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied once all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there are time constraints for deliveries before the harvest window and pickups to prevent crop spoilage, implying time window constraints. The capacity of the trucks is also a factor, as well as distance restrictions for accessibility in remote areas, which translates to vehicle distance limits. Given these specifics, the most appropriate variant is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Load, and Time Windows.

Deliveries must precede pickups to avoid contamination. Vehicles have limited capacity, and routes are restricted by a distance limit to reduce fuel costs. The challenge is to optimize paths for servicing all parks efficiently while ensuring no vehicle exceeds its range or load capacity.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering gardening tools, fertilizers, and equipment) and backhaul (collecting litter and debris) activities with the condition that deliveries must precede pickups to avoid contamination. This indicates a "B" (backhaul) requirement rather than "MB" (mixed backhaul), as backhaul can only happen after all linehaul demands are met.

Capacity limits and timing are also critical. Given these details, the most appropriate variant is VRPBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows. The "O" (open route) feature is not applicable here as the description does not suggest that vehicles do not need to return to the depot.

Description: Your event logistics team must transport inflatable tents, stages, and audio systems from your storage facility (<loc_depot>) to multiple conference venues (<loc_customer>, etc.). Each venue requires a unique combination of bulky items with total weights (<demand> kg). Delivery vans have strict payload limits (<capacity> kg) to prevent tipping or damage. Drivers complete their routes by unloading at the final venue and ending their shift there. The goal is to minimize total mileage while ensuring no van overloads, guaranteeing all convention sites receive their setups on time.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each delivery van has a strict payload limit to prevent tipping or damage, indicating a capacity constraint. The objective is to minimize total mileage while ensuring no van overloads and all venues receive their setups on time, which aligns with the characteristics of the CVRP (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem) where the primary focus is on not exceeding the vehicle capacity. There are no explicit mentions of open routes, backhaul demands, distance limits for vehicles, or specific time windows for deliveries, making CVRP the most appropriate variant from the given list.

Description: A pharmaceutical company delivers temperature-sensitive biologics between research labs and clinical trial sites. Each site has rigid delivery time windows (TW) to maintain trial protocols. Refrigerated vehicles are limited by cargo capacity (C) due to cold storage requirements and must stay within a daily distance limit (L) to adhere to driver working-hour regulations. The goal is to design routes that honor all time constraints, avoid overloading trucks, and comply with distance limits to prevent delays in critical medical research timelines.
Reason: The problem description mentions specific constraints including time windows (TW) for deliveries, cargo capacity (C) limitations due to cold storage requirements, and a daily distance limit (L) for the vehicles. Since the problem involves closed routes (vehicles return to depot as implied by the need to maintain a consistent schedule and protocol), there is no indication of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, and it does not specify an open route. Thus, the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Capacity, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.

Label: VRPBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 78
Description: A film production company is shooting in rugged mountainous terrain. Each day, trucks must deliver cameras, lighting rigs, and set props (<demand_linehaul>) to filming locations (<loc_customer>). After setup, they collect used props, discarded materials, and equipment for reuse or disposal (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have a limited capacity (<capacity>) to handle both deliveries and pickups. The mountainous roads impose a strict distance limit (<distance_limit>) on routes to prevent exceeding fuel reserves, as the nearest refueling station is hours away. The goal is to optimize routes so crews receive everything needed while efficiently repatriating waste without overloading trucks or straying beyond safe travel distances.
Reason: The problem description indicates the presence of both linehaul and backhaul demands, with a specific note that vehicles have a limited capacity to handle both. Additionally, there is a strict distance limit on routes due to fuel constraints, which aligns with the "L" (distance limits) feature. The requirement to manage both deliveries and pickups simultaneously suggests a mixed backhaul scenario, fitting the "MB" attribute. There is no mention of open routes or time windows, so "O" and "TW" are not applicable. Therefore, the most suitable variant that encompasses these features is VRPMBL, representing a Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Distance Limits.

Description: An education nonprofit transports portable computer labs to underserved schools (<loc_customer>), delivering equipment (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting completed student projects (<demand_backhaul>) for exhibitions. Vans with capacity <capacity> depart from the tech center (<loc_depot>) and must complete all stops within <distance_limit> miles due to perishable science experiment components. The flexible routing allows any combination of drop-offs and pickups while ensuring no van is overloaded and all educational materials reach their destinations fresh.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the vans have a capacity limit, which is represented by "C" in the variants. Additionally, there are distance limits for the vans, which corresponds to the "L" feature. The backhaul demand (collecting completed student projects) can only be satisfied after the linehaul demand (delivering equipment) has been met, aligning with the "B" feature. Since the vehicles must return to the depot and there is no mention of time window constraints, the most appropriate variant is VRPBL.

Description: A healthcare logistics firm delivers sterilized medical tools to hospitals (<demand_linehaul>) and collects contaminated waste (<demand_backhaul>) for disposal. Each vehicle (<capacity> kg capacity) must reach hospitals during their designated restocking hours (<time_windows>), deliver supplies first, then pick up hazardous materials. The route must respect strict biohazard handling protocols, ensuring no pickups occur until deliveries are finalized. Trucks conclude their routes at the final hospital, optimizing fuel use and adhering to strict safety and timing constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes the need for deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) with a specific order of operations, where backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met. Additionally, there are strict time window constraints for hospital restocking hours, and capacity limits for the vehicles. The route does not return to the depot, indicating an open route. Therefore, the most appropriate variant that encompasses these requirements is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, Time Windows, and Open Routes.

Description: An adventure sports company rents kayaks and camping gear to customers at remote lakes and campgrounds. Vehicles must deliver equipment to drop-off points by morning time windows for rentals, then return later to collect gear (backhaul) after sunset. Each truck’s capacity is constrained by equipment size, and routes must stay within daily distance limits to comply with operator shift durations. Time windows for pickups are critical to avoid leaving equipment unattended overnight.
Reason: The problem description includes several key constraints: the need for backhaul (returning to collect gear), distance limits for each truck, and time windows for both delivery and pickup. Since the vehicles must return to the depot after completing their tasks, it does not fit the "O" (open route) criteria. The scenario also involves both linehaul (delivering kayaks and camping gear) and backhaul (collecting gear) simultaneously, which aligns with the "MB" (mixed backhaul) characteristic. Given these specifics, the most fitting variant is VRPMBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.

Description: Following a major earthquake, construction crews must deliver reinforced steel beams and concrete additives to damaged urban areas. Each site (<loc_customer>) has a time window (<time_windows>) for material arrival to align with reconstruction schedules. Heavy-duty trucks (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a regional depot (<loc_depot>), but mountainous terrain limits their travel range (<distance_limit> km). Routes must prioritize timely delivery while avoiding overloading and ensuring no truck exceeds its maximum journey distance.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each site has a time window for material arrival, indicating the presence of time window constraints (TW). Additionally, the heavy-duty trucks have a travel range limit due to mountainous terrain, which indicates distance limits (L). The requirement for timely delivery while ensuring no truck exceeds its maximum journey distance and avoiding overloading points towards the need to manage both capacity and these operational constraints. Since there is no mention of backhaul demands or open routes, the most fitting variant from the list provided, considering the presence of capacity (C), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW), is VRPLTW.

After processing, the same vehicles (<capacity>) distribute tested blood products to hospitals, mixing donation pickups (<demand_backhaul>) and deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) based on urgency. Strict time windows apply for both collection (donor availability) and delivery (surgical schedules). The system prioritizes life-saving deliveries while maintaining donor engagement.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhaul (MB) as the system handles both donation pickups and deliveries, capacity (C) constraints due to the use of the same vehicles for processing and distribution, and strict time windows (TW) for both collection and delivery. The variant VRPMBLTW encompasses all these characteristics: mixed backhaul, capacity, and time window constraints.

Description: A florist network needs to deliver fresh flowers to retail stores across the city while collecting empty vases from prior deliveries. Each store has a strict time window for flower delivery (TW) to ensure freshness, and vases must be collected afterward (B). Delivery trucks (C) start from a central depot (O) and must prioritize flower deliveries before vase pickups. Routes must stay within a daily distance limit (L) to avoid driver fatigue, ending at the last customer location.
Reason: The problem description specifies strict time windows for deliveries (TW), a need to collect vases after delivering flowers which indicates backhaul (B) with the condition that deliveries must be prioritized before pickups, and a daily distance limit for each route (L). The routes start from a central depot and do not specifically mention ending at the depot, but since the last point is a customer location, it implies the route does return to the depot, so "O" (open route) is not applicable. Therefore, the variant that best fits these requirements is VRPBLTW.

Description: An automotive parts distributor supplies dealerships with new components (linehaul) and retrieves faulty or recalled parts (backhaul). Dealerships mandate delivery during business hours (time windows) and require pickups only after inspecting returned items. Trucks must deliver parts first to ensure inventory availability, then collect defective items without exceeding <capacity> cubic feet. Routes end at the last dealership to streamline operations.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks must deliver (linehaul) parts first before collecting (backhaul) defective items, which aligns with the "B" backhaul requirement. Additionally, there are specific time window constraints ("TW") for deliveries and pickups during business hours. The capacity constraint is also mentioned but is not the primary differentiator among the options given the presence of other features. There is no mention of open routes or distance limits, so these do not apply.

Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 52
Description: A film production company needs to transport equipment like cameras and lighting gear to multiple filming locations (linehaul) and retrieve used props and materials (backhaul) for storage. Each vehicle can carry up to <capacity> kg of equipment and must not exceed a daily driving distance of <distance_limit> km. Routes are open-ended, ending at the final stop. The key is to first deliver all necessary equipment to each set, then collect props from locations without overloading trucks or exceeding distance limits, ensuring efficient use of resources and timely service.
Reason: The problem involves transporting equipment to multiple locations (linehaul) and retrieving used props and materials (backhaul), with the backhaul only occurring after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there are capacity constraints for the vehicles and daily driving distance limits. The routes are open-ended, meaning they do not return to the depot. Since the description specifies both backhaul and linehaul, but indicates that backhaul can only happen after linehaul is completed, and also mentions open routes, capacity, and distance limits, the most fitting variant is OVRPB (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul).

Description: A preservation organization must deliver conservation tools, materials, and protective gear to remote archaeological sites scattered across a mountainous region. After completing deliveries (linehaul), vehicles must collect damaged artifacts for restoration at a central museum. Each vehicle has a maximum capacity, and routes must not exceed a strict distance limit to ensure safe operation without refueling. The goal is to plan efficient routes that first service all sites with supplies before retrieving artifacts, ensuring no vehicle overloads or exceeds its travel range.
Reason: The problem specifies that vehicles must first complete deliveries (linehaul) before collecting damaged artifacts (backhaul), with a strict distance limit for each route. There is no mention of open routes or time windows, but the capacity and distance limits are important factors. The requirement to service all sites with supplies before retrieving artifacts aligns with the backhaul condition, and the presence of distance limits means "L" is also relevant. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBL, which includes backhaul and distance limits.

Description: Conservationists use off-road vehicles to deploy GPS collars on endangered animals in remote forests (linehaul) and later retrieve data storage modules from collars (backhaul). Each vehicle has limited space for collars and data containers (capacity). Routes must stay within operational range (distance limit) and conclude at the final data retrieval site. The goal is to cover all deployment sites efficiently while ensuring collars are placed before data can be collected.
Reason: The problem description mentions the need for vehicles to have both linehaul (deploying GPS collars) and backhaul (retrieving data storage modules) operations, with the specific requirement that all linehaul tasks must be completed before backhaul can occur. Additionally, there is a mention of a capacity constraint (limited space for collars and data containers) and a distance limit (routes must stay within operational range). Since there are no indications of time window constraints or open routes (vehicles returning to a final data retrieval site), the most fitting variant is VRPBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and limited vehicle Distance.

Description: An adventure sports company rents kayaks, climbing gear, and camping equipment to remote trailheads (<loc_customer>). Their delivery trucks first transport all rented items (linehaul) to outdoor activity sites, then return later to collect the returned gear (backhaul). The route must respect the truck’s <capacity> kg limit, deliver before picking up, and conclude at the last equipment collection point.
Reason: The problem specifies a capacity constraint for the trucks, indicating that the "C" (capacity) attribute is relevant. Additionally, it mentions that the delivery trucks first transport all rented items (linehaul) to outdoor activity sites and then return later to collect the returned gear (backhaul), which aligns with the "B" (backhaul) attribute. The requirement that the route must deliver before picking up suggests a strict order of operations where backhaul can only occur after linehaul, fitting the definition of "B". There is no mention of distance limits ("L"), time windows ("TW"), or the need for open routes ("O"). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches this description is CVRPB, which stands for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul.

Trucks have a strict weight capacity (<capacity> tons) to avoid overloading, and each route must not exceed a maximum distance (<distance_limit> km) to ensure timely depot returns. The challenge is to balance delivery and pickup stops while adhering to capacity and distance constraints, ensuring efficient use of vehicles and minimizing total travel costs.
Reason: The problem description mentions both linehaul (delivering empty containers) and backhaul (picking up filled containers), indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. It also specifies that each truck has a strict weight capacity and a maximum distance limit for routes.

Trucks (<capacity>) must operate within vendors' narrow time windows (<time_windows>) between peak hours. Deliveries and collections can occur in any order (MB), and trucks park overnight at their last stop (O). The challenge is to balance freshness and waste reduction while optimizing routes.
Reason: The problem involves multiple aspects: backhaul (collecting unsold perishables), linehaul (restocking with ingredients), mixed backhaul (deliveries and collections can occur in any order), time window constraints (vendors have narrow time windows for service), and the routes are open (trucks park overnight at their last stop).

Description: An environmental NGO deploys boats from a coastal depot (<loc_depot>) to distribute recycling bins (<demand_linehaul>) to tourist beaches (<loc_customer>) while collecting ocean plastic waste (<demand_backhaul>). Each vessel has a payload limit (<capacity>) and must operate within strict nautical miles (<distance_limit>) due to fuel constraints. Boats finish routes at the last beach to avoid backtracking. The challenge is interleaving bin drop-offs and waste pickups efficiently across scattered islands.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the boats (vehicles) have a payload limit, which corresponds to the capacity constraint (C). The boats also have a distance limit due to fuel constraints, indicating a limited travel distance (L). Additionally, there is a need for managing both the distribution of recycling bins (linehaul demand) and the collection of ocean plastic waste (backhaul demand), where backhaul can only be done after all linehaul demands are satisfied. This specific combination points towards a VRP with backhaul and distance limit, without the need for the vehicles to return to the depot, making it an open route (O). However, since the condition specifically states that backhaul can occur only after all linehaul demands are met, we use "B" instead of "MB", which would allow simultaneous handling. No time window constraints are mentioned. Therefore, the most fitting variant is OVRPBL.

Each zone has specific needs (<demand>), and delivery trucks (<capacity>) are limited in payload. The goal is to plan routes that maximize the number of kits delivered while minimizing travel distance, ensuring all affected areas receive supplies without overloading any vehicle.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each disaster zone has specific needs (demand) and the delivery trucks have limited payload capacity. Additionally, the goal is to minimize travel distance, implying a consideration for vehicle distance limits. There is no mention of backhaul, mixed backhaul, or time windows, and it is assumed that vehicles will return to the depot after completing their routes, which rules out the "O" (open route) variant.

Routes are constrained by a maximum travel distance (<distance_limit>) due to oxygen and battery limitations. After the final artifact is secured, vessels remain at the last site to await transport to a research facility, avoiding return to the surface depot until mission completion.
Reason: The problem description mentions that there are strict capacity limits for both supplies and delicate finds, indicating a capacity constraint. Additionally, it specifies that routes are constrained by a maximum travel distance due to oxygen and battery limitations, which points towards a distance limit. The scenario also describes a backhaul situation where after the final artifact is secured, vessels remain at the last site to await transport to a research facility, suggesting that backhaul demand (retrieving artifacts) can only be satisfied once all linehaul demands (deploying diving gear and equipment) are met. Finally, the condition of not returning to the surface depot until mission completion indicates an open route. Given these details, the most fitting variant is VRPBL, as it includes capacity (C), backhaul (B), and distance limits (L).

The trucks must deliver equipment first, then return to collect it, all while adhering to the <capacity> ton limit. The solution must balance efficiency with strict time constraints to ensure timely service for vulnerable patients.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints for both delivery and pickup, a capacity limit for the trucks, and involves backhaul (picking up the devices after use). However, it is not specified that the backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul (delivery) demand, which suggests a mixed backhaul scenario.

Parking lots have specific time windows (<time_windows>) when charging is needed (e.g., office lots during work hours, residential areas overnight). The trucks can both deliver charge (linehaul) and collect payment data (backhaul) at each stop in any order. Routes must respect vehicle capacity, maximum shift duration (<duration_limit> hours), and time windows while minimizing total distance traveled.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: each truck has a battery capacity (C), there are time windows for service at parking lots (TW), and the trucks can both deliver charge (linehaul) and collect payment data (backhaul) in any order (MB). Additionally, the routes must respect vehicle capacity, maximum shift duration, and time windows while minimizing total distance traveled.

Description: A renewable energy company operates offshore wind farms and must deliver maintenance supplies (e.g., lubricants, turbine blades, and electrical components) from a coastal depot to each turbine site. Each wind turbine requires specific parts, and the delivery vessels have limited cargo space. Routes must be planned to service all turbines efficiently, ensuring no vessel exceeds its capacity, while minimizing fuel consumption and operational costs. The challenge includes navigating marine routes and reaching remote offshore locations.
Reason: <Error> at parse json 
 {
    'reason': 'The problem description mentions that each delivery vessel has limited cargo space, which indicates a capacity constraint (C). Additionally, the need to minimize fuel consumption and operational costs, along with the mention of navigating marine routes, suggests there might be distance limits (L) for the vessels. However, since the problem specifically focuses on servicing all turbines efficiently while not exceeding the vessel's capacity, and there is no explicit mention of open routes, backhauls, mixed backhauls, or time windows, the most fitting variant is CVRP, where "C" stands for capacity and "VRP" for Vehicle Routing Problem. The "L" (distance limit) is typically considered within the operational cost minimization in such problems, but it does not explicitly require a different classification here.',

Description: Agricultural tech firms deploy drones (<demand_linehaul>) equipped with sensors to monitor crops at farms (<loc_customer>). After delivering drones, technicians use the same vehicles (<capacity>) to collect soil samples and data storage devices (<demand_backhaul>) from the farms. Starting from the tech hub (<loc_depot>), trucks first distribute drones to ensure all farms receive their units. Only after all deliveries are complete do they proceed to gather samples, adhering to weight limits for both drone payloads and collected materials. Routes end at the final sample pickup site to streamline logistics.
Reason: The problem involves delivering drones (linehaul) to farms first, and only after all deliveries are complete, the vehicles proceed to collect soil samples and data storage devices (backhaul). This indicates a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there are capacity constraints for both the drone payloads and the collected materials, but since other features like backhaul are present, the "C" (capacity) is implicitly included and does not need to be specified. There is no mention of open routes, distance limits, or time windows, so the most appropriate variant is VRPB.

Description: A veterinary service delivers mobile clinics to livestock farms for scheduled health checkups and retrieves them afterward. Each farm has an appointment time window for the clinic’s visit. Delivery vehicles (<capacity> capacity) must first deliver clinic equipment and then collect waste materials and used supplies during pickup. The route must ensure all farms are serviced within their time slots without overloading trucks, balancing animal care needs with logistical efficiency.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each farm has an appointment time window for the clinic’s visit, which corresponds to the "TW" (time window constraints) attribute. Additionally, there is a need to deliver clinic equipment and then collect waste materials and used supplies, implying a backhaul situation where both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, corresponding to the "MB" (mixed backhaul) attribute. The capacity of the delivery vehicles is also mentioned, but this is subsumed by the more specific MB attribute. There is no mention of open routes or vehicle distance limits, so "O" and "L" are not applicable. Therefore, the most appropriate variant that matches these characteristics is VRPMBTW.

Description: A livestock farm needs to relocate herds between pastures and processing facilities. The central depot is at <loc_depot>, and transfer points are at <loc_customer>. Each vehicle can carry a maximum of <capacity> livestock units due to space and safety regulations. The animals must be transported within a single trip without exceeding a route distance of <distance_limit> kilometers to prevent stress. The total number of livestock at each transfer point is <demand>, and all must be moved while adhering to vehicle capacity and distance limits. Plan routes to ensure all livestock are transported efficiently while minimizing total travel distance.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each vehicle has a maximum capacity for livestock units and there is a distance limit to prevent stress on the animals. There is no mention of open routes, backhaul, mixed backhaul, or time window constraints. Therefore, the most fitting variant is CVRP, which stands for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, considering the capacity constraint and distance limit (which is a form of capacity in terms of distance). The "C" (capacity) and "L" (distance limits) are both present, but according to the instructions, when other features like "B", "O", or "TW" are not present, we should choose the variant with "C".

Description: A tool rental firm delivers power tools and machinery to construction sites and collects them once projects are complete. Each truck has a capacity <capacity>, and drivers can sequence deliveries to new sites and pickups from finished sites in any order. The depot and job sites are <locs>, with tool delivery demands <demand_linehaul> and return pickups <demand_backhaul>. The challenge is to optimize routes to reduce fuel costs while adhering to vehicle capacity constraints.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles have a capacity constraint, and there is a need to sequence both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul). The backhaul demand can be satisfied only after all linehaul demands are met, which fits the "B" (backhaul) characteristic. There is no mention of open routes, distance limits for the vehicles, or time window constraints. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches this description is VRPB, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul.

Description: Biologists need to place motion-activated sensors in a wildlife reserve. Each deployment site (<loc_customer>) has a required number of sensors (<demand>). Rangers use all-terrain vehicles (<capacity> sensors) from a research station (<loc_depot>). Deployments must occur during specific time windows (<time_window>) when animal activity is low. Routes must not exceed daily distance limits (<distance_limit>) to prevent overexertion. Teams finish at the last site, avoiding unnecessary backtracking through rugged terrain.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: capacity (capacity of all-terrain vehicles), distance limits (daily distance limits for routes), and time window constraints (specific time windows for deployments). There is no mention of backhauling or open routes, which means the most fitting variant should include "L" for distance limits and "TW" for time windows. The presence of a depot and the requirement to finish at the last site without unnecessary backtracking indicates a closed route. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPLTW, as it covers all mentioned constraints without including irrelevant features like backhaul or open routes.

Description: An electronics retailer delivers smartphones (linehaul) and collects old batteries for recycling (backhaul). Deliveries must arrive within <time_window> for customer satisfaction, while battery pickups adhere to hazardous waste handling protocols. Trucks have a <capacity> item limit and a <distance_limit> km range to ensure electric vehicle battery life. Drivers finish routes at the final recycling drop-off to optimize resource use.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the electronics retailer delivers smartphones (linehaul) and collects old batteries for recycling (backhaul), indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, it mentions time windows for deliveries to ensure customer satisfaction and distance limits due to electric vehicle battery life. There is no explicit requirement for the vehicles to return to the depot, but since the final stop is at a recycling drop-off, we do not classify this as an open route. Thus, the most specific variant that matches all these criteria is VRPMBLTW.

Description: A building supply company delivers lumber, cement, and tools to construction sites (<loc_customer>) while hauling away construction debris for disposal. Trucks (<capacity> kg) begin at the supply depot (<loc_depot>), first delivering materials (linehaul demand: <demand_linehaul> kg). After unloading all supplies, they proceed to collect waste concrete, wood scraps, or rubble (backhaul demand: <demand_backhaul> kg) from job sites. The route sequence ensures debris is picked up only after material deliveries to avoid mixing hazardous waste with fresh supplies. Vehicles finish at the final debris collection point.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks first deliver materials (linehaul) and then, after unloading all supplies, proceed to collect waste (backhaul), ensuring debris is picked up only after material deliveries. This clearly indicates a backhaul demand which can be satisfied only after all the linehaul demand is satisfied. There is no mention of open routes, distance limits, or time window constraints. The capacity of the trucks is mentioned but is less specific compared to the backhaul and linehaul demands. Thus, the most fitting variant is VRPB.

Description: A renewable energy firm services offshore wind turbines by delivering repair kits (linehaul) and hauling away decommissioned turbine blades (backhaul). Maintenance must occur during tidal windows (time constraints) to access restricted zones, and vessels must return to port within 14 hours (duration limit) due to crew safety regulations. Each boat has limited capacity for both new parts and scrap materials, requiring precise load balancing.
Reason: The problem involves linehaul (delivering repair kits) and backhaul (hauling away decommissioned turbine blades) operations, with the requirement that maintenance must occur during specific tidal windows (time window constraints), and each boat has a limited capacity for both new parts and scrap materials. Additionally, there is a 14-hour duration limit for crew safety, which can be considered as a distance or time constraint. The boats need to return to port, indicating it is not an open route. Given these factors, VRPMBLTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Load, and Time Windows) best fits the scenario, even though "L" typically stands for distance limits, in this context, we interpret it as a form of operational constraint due to the 14-hour limit.

Description: A space agency needs to transport specialized equipment to multiple launch sites for satellite deployments while retrieving used rocket components for recycling. Vehicles must first deliver heavy machinery (linehaul) before collecting spent parts (backhaul). Each truck’s capacity (<capacity>) is constrained by weight and space limits. Routes cannot exceed a distance threshold (<distance_limit>) due to restricted access roads and safety protocols. Once the final component is retrieved, vehicles remain at the last site to await further instructions.
Reason: The problem description specifies that vehicles must first deliver heavy machinery (linehaul) before collecting spent parts (backhaul), indicating a backhaul demand which can be satisfied only after the linehaul is completed. This matches the "B" characteristic. Additionally, there are distance constraints for the routes, which aligns with the "L" feature. The capacity of the trucks is also mentioned, but this is typically implied in VRP variants and does not require a specific "C" tag when other features like "B" or "L" are present. There is no mention of time windows or the need for an open route, so "TW" and "O" are not applicable. Therefore, the most fitting variant is VRPBL.

Description: A scientific logistics provider delivers lab reagents to research institutions and collects hazardous chemical waste. Deliveries (linehaul) of materials must happen before pickups (backhaul) of waste to ensure experiments can proceed. Institutions have time windows for material receipt (e.g., before lab hours end) and waste pickup (e.g., after analysis). Vehicles comply with capacity limits for both supplies and waste, stay within daily distance limits, and conclude routes at the final facility to streamline operations.
Reason: The problem description specifies that deliveries (linehaul) must happen before pickups (backhaul), indicating a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands, which fits the "B" feature. Additionally, there are time windows for both delivery and pickup ("TW"), and the vehicles have daily distance limits ("L"). Since the routes conclude at the final facility, this does not fit the "O" (open route) condition. The capacity limit is also mentioned, but as per the instructions, it is ignored when other features like B, L, or TW are present. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBLTW.

Each farm’s order has a specific volume or weight (<demand>), and tractor-trailers have fixed capacity limits (<capacity>). Routes must ensure no vehicle exceeds its load capacity while servicing all farms. Drivers conclude their routes at the last farm, optimizing fuel usage and operational efficiency.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the tractor-trailers have fixed capacity limits and must not exceed their load capacity, which points to a capacity constraint. There is no mention of backhaul (B), distance limits (L), open routes (O), or time window constraints (TW). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the given problem is CVRP, which stands for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem.

Description: A marine research institute services a network of sensor buoys along a coastline. Maintenance vessels (<capacity>) launch from port (<loc_depot>) to both replenish buoy power cells (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieve data modules (<demand_backhaul>) at waypoints (<loc_customer>). Strict fuel constraints (<distance_limit>) prevent vessels from returning to port, requiring them to dock at coastal stations after final service.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: the presence of a capacity for the maintenance vessels, linehaul demand (replenishing power cells), backhaul demand (retrieving data modules) which can be satisfied only after all linehaul demands are met, distance limits due to strict fuel constraints, and an open route as the vessels do not return to port but instead dock at coastal stations.

After the clinic closes, the same trucks collect used supplies (<demand_backhaul>) for sterilization. Capacity constraints (<capacity>) require careful planning to avoid overloading during setup phases. Routes finalize at the last pickup point to maximize efficiency, as clinics operate independently post-deployment.
Reason: The problem description mentions the transportation of medical equipment (linehaul) and the collection of used supplies (backhaul), which indicates a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, there are strict time windows for setup, and the routes do not return to the depot after the last pickup, indicating an open route. The presence of capacity constraints is also noted, but this is already implied by the "MB" in the variant. Therefore, the most appropriate variant that fits all these criteria is VRPMBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Linehaul, and Time Windows, and is an open route.

Description: A marine research institute schedules ships to service autonomous buoys in a coastal network. Each vessel (<capacity> kg cargo) leaves port (<loc_depot>) to perform mixed tasks: delivering fresh sensors (<demand_linehaul>) to some buoys (<loc_customer>) while retrieving data modules (<demand_backhaul>) from others. Due to fuel constraints (<distance_limit> nautical miles), ships must complete routes at their final buoy location. The challenge is to balance sensor replacements and data retrievals without exceeding weight limits or voyage ranges.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each ship has a cargo capacity, which aligns with the 'C' (capacity) attribute. It also specifies that there are mixed tasks involving both delivering fresh sensors (linehaul) and retrieving data modules (backhaul), which matches the 'MB' (mixed backhaul) characteristic. Additionally, the scenario includes a distance limit for the ships, indicating they have a maximum range they can travel before needing to stop, which corresponds to the 'L' (distance limits) feature. The requirement for ships to complete their routes at the final buoy location, without returning to the depot, points towards an 'O' (open route) condition. However, since the 'MB' (mixed backhaul) already implies that both linehaul and backhaul demands are managed, and considering all other given attributes, the most specific variant that fits this description is VRPMBL.

Their trucks must deliver empty containers to customers and retrieve filled containers for redistribution. The vehicles can sequence deliveries and pickups in any order along their route, provided the combined weight of containers being delivered (demand) and retrieved (pickup) does not exceed the truck’s capacity <capacity>. The locations of the central depot and 20 customer sites are <locs>, with each container requiring <demand_linehaul> for delivery and <demand_backhaul> for retrieval. The challenge is to plan routes that maximize container turnover while ensuring no truck overloads.
Reason: The problem involves a central depot and multiple customer sites, with the need to both deliver (linehaul) and retrieve (backhaul) containers. The key constraints are that the combined weight of containers for delivery and retrieval must not exceed the truck’s capacity, and the backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands have been met. There is no mention of distance limits, open routes, or time window constraints in the description.

Deliveries must occur within strict time windows, while pickups follow afterward. Vehicles are constrained by capacity and distance limits to maintain timely service. The challenge is to plan routes that first fulfill all document deliveries, then efficiently retrieve returned items, ending at the last pickup location without returning to the central hub.
Reason: The problem description indicates several key features: (1) the need to first deliver all documents and then pick up returned items, suggesting a backhaul ("B") requirement; (2) strict time windows for deliveries, indicating time window constraints ("TW"); (3) vehicles have capacity and distance limits, though "L" is more specific to distance which is mentioned; (4) the routes end at the last pickup location without returning to the central hub, implying an open route ("O").

Description: A courier company provides time-sensitive document delivery and package returns. Clients require urgent deliveries (e.g., legal contracts) within strict deadlines, while returns must be collected afterward. Each delivery location has a specific time window for service, and pickups can only occur after all deliveries in the route are completed. Vehicles must prioritize deliveries first to meet time constraints, ensuring their cargo capacity isn’t exceeded by the combined weight of outgoing and returned items. Routes conclude at the last return pickup point.
Reason: The problem description specifies that deliveries (linehaul) must be completed before pickups (backhaul), and each delivery location has a specific time window for service. This indicates the presence of backhaul demands (B) and time window constraints (TW). Additionally, there is a mention of cargo capacity not being exceeded, but since other features like B and TW are present, the capacity (C) is implicitly considered. The route concludes at the last return pickup point, which suggests an open route (O). However, the open route feature is less emphasized compared to the strict requirement of time windows and the sequence of linehaul followed by backhaul.

Routes terminate at the last collection point to maximize efficiency.
Reason: The problem description specifies that all deliveries (linehaul) must be completed before pickups (backhaul), which aligns with the "B" variant where backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands.

Each venue has a setup time window <time_windows> for deliveries (linehaul) and a later window for pickups (backhaul). Trucks with <capacity> ton capacity must first deliver all equipment efficiently before returning to collect items post-event, ensuring strict adherence to time windows and load limits.
Reason: The problem description mentions a setup time window for deliveries (linehaul) and a later window for pickups (backhaul), indicating the presence of both linehaul and backhaul demands with strict adherence to time windows. Additionally, there are capacity constraints on the trucks. The "MB" (mixed backhaul) and "TW" (time window) attributes are key here, as they indicate that both delivery and pickup can be done within the same route, and each has its own specific time window. The "C" (capacity) constraint is also present but is considered less specific in this context when other features like "MB" and "TW" are present.

Description: A polar research organization must deliver supplies (<demand>) to isolated Arctic stations (<loc_customer>) during narrow seasonal ice-free windows (<time_windows>). Cargo planes (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a base (<loc_depot>), but must return before fuel depletion (<distance_limit> km). Critical supplies like food and equipment must be delivered before winter sets in, requiring precise timing to avoid trapping crews in extreme conditions.
Reason: The problem description specifies several key constraints: (1) cargo planes have a capacity limit, (2) they must return to the base before fuel depletion, indicating a distance limit, and (3) there are narrow seasonal ice-free windows for delivery, which translates into time window constraints. Since the requirement for the vehicles to return to the depot rules out the "O" variants, and no specific mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demand is made, the most fitting variant is VRPLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits and Time Windows.

Description: A tech firm must deliver sensitive servers and equipment to data centers across a region. Each data center has a strict installation time window (TW) to avoid service disruptions. Delivery trucks are subject to weight capacity limits (C) to prevent overloading fragile components. Additionally, vehicles must return to the central warehouse within a daily distance limit (L) to ensure maintenance and fuel availability. The goal is to plan routes that meet all time constraints, avoid exceeding vehicle capacities, and respect distance limits to maintain operational reliability.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks have strict installation time windows (TW) at each data center, are subject to weight capacity limits (C), and must return to the central warehouse within a daily distance limit (L). Since backhaul (B) or mixed backhaul (MB) conditions and open route (O) scenarios are not mentioned, these attributes can be excluded. The key elements here are the presence of time windows, capacity constraints, and distance limits, which directly correspond to the VRPBLTW variant.

Description: An art logistics firm transports artworks to galleries (<loc_customer>) for exhibitions and retrieves pieces from closing shows. Fragile items limit vehicle capacity (<capacity>). Galleries impose strict time windows (<time_windows>) for installations/deinstallations. Routes are open (no depot return) to accommodate last-minute venue changes. Balance mixed loads to prevent damage and meet all scheduling constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes the need for handling fragile items, which limits vehicle capacity (C), strict time windows for installations/deinstallations (TW), and open routes to accommodate last-minute venue changes (O). Additionally, the requirement to balance mixed loads suggests that both linehaul (delivering artworks) and backhaul (retrieving artworks) demands can be satisfied simultaneously (MB). Given these constraints, the most specific variant is OVRPMBLTW, which covers all mentioned requirements: open routes, mixed backhaul, load balancing, and time window constraints.

Description: A non-profit distributes medical equipment (e.g., diagnostic tools, vaccines) to remote clinics for short-term health campaigns. After the campaign, unused or expired items must be collected. Deliveries must precede pickups to ensure equipment availability. Each vehicle has a capacity limit. Clinics have delivery time windows (aligned with staff schedules) and pickup deadlines after the campaign. The goal is to minimize travel distance while adhering to constraints, with routes terminating at the last pickup site.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles have a capacity limit, which aligns with the "C" attribute. However, since the description also mentions specific time windows for deliveries and pickups, as well as the need to collect unused or expired items after the campaign (indicating backhaul), the "TW" and "B" attributes are more specifically relevant. The presence of both linehaul (delivering medical equipment) and backhaul (collecting unused or expired items) demands, where backhaul can only happen after all linehaul is completed, points towards the "VRPBTW" variant. Additionally, the requirement for routes to terminate at the last pickup site suggests an open route, but this does not override the more specific requirements of having both linehaul and backhaul within defined time windows. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBTW, emphasizing time window constraints and the sequence of operations.

Description: A high-end florist delivers custom bouquets and floral arrangements to multiple wedding venues. Each venue has a time window `[e_i, l_i]` tied to the ceremony start time, and floral freshness requires refrigerated trucks with limited capacity `Q` (due to space and cooling constraints). Service time `s_i` accounts for precise unloading and setup. The goal is to ensure timely deliveries while maximizing bouquet freshness and minimizing mileage.
Reason: The problem description includes specific time windows for each venue, which aligns with the "TW" (time window) attribute. Additionally, the capacity of the refrigerated trucks is a key constraint, corresponding to the "C" (capacity) attribute. Since the vehicles have a limited capacity and need to adhere to strict time windows, but there is no mention of open routes, backhaul, or distance limits, the most appropriate variant is "CVRPTW".

Description: An agricultural supply cooperative delivers seeds and fertilizers to farms (<loc_customer>) and collects harvested crops from backhaul customers. Trucks start at the depot (<loc_depot>), first fulfilling linehaul demands (e.g., farm inputs) before collecting crops (backhaul). The vehicle’s capacity (<capacity>) must accommodate both outgoing and incoming loads. Routes conclude at the last crop collection site, ensuring efficient logistics and minimizing transportation costs.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks first fulfill linehaul demands (delivering seeds and fertilizers) before collecting crops (backhaul), indicating a backhaul condition where backhaul can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, the mention of "vehicle’s capacity must accommodate both outgoing and incoming loads" implies a capacity constraint. There is no explicit mention of distance limits, open routes, or time window constraints. Therefore, the most specific variant that fits this scenario is VRPB, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul.

Description: A sports league operator delivers sports equipment to stadiums before games and collects it post-event. Each venue has strict time windows for setup and teardown. Delivery trucks must first distribute gear (linehaul) to all locations, then return to collect the equipment (backhaul). Capacity constraints limit the number of items per truck, and routes are restricted to a maximum distance to cover multiple venues efficiently. All deliveries must precede game starts, and pickups must align with post-game cleanup schedules.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: capacity constraints, backhaul (collecting equipment post-event), distance limits for routes, and strict time windows for setup and teardown. The requirement that deliveries (linehaul) must be completed before the pickups (backhaul) aligns with the "B" variant, which stipulates that backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, the presence of both time window and distance limit constraints further narrows down the choice to VRPBLTW, as it encompasses all these specific requirements.

Description: A fleet of mobile charging vans services electric vehicles (EVs) across a city, providing on-demand charging and battery diagnostics. Each van starts at a depot (<loc_depot>) with a limited battery-swap inventory (<capacity>). Customers (<loc_customer>) request either charging (delivery) or battery health checks (pickup of diagnostic data), with mixed sequencing allowed. Time windows (<time_windows>) reflect parking availability or driver schedules. Vans conclude routes at their final stop without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vans do not return to the depot at the end of their routes, which aligns with the "O" (open route) attribute. Additionally, it mentions time windows for service, corresponding to the "TW" (time window constraints) feature. There is a limited battery-swap inventory per van, indicating a capacity constraint, but since we are also considering the open route and time window features, the most specific variant that fits this scenario is OVRPTW.

Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile vaccination units that visit neighborhoods (<loc_customer>) to administer vaccines and collect biohazard waste (e.g., used syringes). Each vehicle starts at a central depot (<loc_depot>) with a cold storage capacity (<capacity>) for vaccines and waste containers. Clinics must operate within strict time windows (<time_windows>) due to community schedules, and service times (<service_time>) vary by location. Vehicles can sequence vaccine delivery and waste pickup in any order (MB) and end routes at the final stop (O). The goal is to maximize coverage while respecting capacity, time constraints, and minimizing travel distance.
Reason: The problem involves multiple constraints: capacity for vaccines and waste, time windows for service, and the ability to sequence vaccine delivery and waste pickup in any order (mixed backhaul). Since the vehicles start at a central depot and end their routes at the final stop, this indicates closed routes rather than open ones. The presence of strict time windows, mixed backhaul capabilities, and capacity limits, without explicit mention of distance limits, leads to the selection of VRPMBTW as the most appropriate variant.

Description: A catering company services <num_customer> event venues (<loc_customer>) by delivering fresh food (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieving equipment (<demand_backhaul>) post-event. Vehicles (capacity <C>) from a kitchen hub (<loc_depot>) must sequence tasks flexibly: some venues need early AM deliveries (5:00–7:00 AM) and late PM pickups (10:00 PM–midnight), while others have inverted schedules. Time windows (<time_windows>) are venue-specific, and capacity limits prevent perishable/return item mixing. Routes minimize idle time between delivery and pickup phases.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: capacity (C), backhaul demand (B) which is only satisfied after linehaul, and time window constraints (TW). There is no indication of open routes (O) or distance limits (L) for the vehicles. The requirement to sequence tasks flexibly with specific time windows for deliveries and pickups, as well as the need to manage both fresh food and equipment without mixing, points towards a VRP variant that can handle these mixed demands and time constraints. The most fitting variant is VRPBTW, as it covers the capacity, backhaul, and time window aspects of the problem.

Description: During a hurricane evacuation, temporary shelters must receive critical supplies (food, water, medical kits) within strict operational time windows (<time_windows>). Relief trucks (<capacity>) depart from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>) and must cover routes within a maximum distance (<distance_limit>) due to fuel shortages. The goal is to deliver supplies to all shelters by their opening times, ensuring no truck exceeds capacity or distance limits, and ending each route at the final shelter served to maximize resource distribution efficiency.
Reason: The problem description specifies that relief trucks have a capacity limit, must adhere to strict operational time windows for deliveries, and are subject to a maximum travel distance. There is no mention of backhaul demand or the requirement for open routes (not returning to the depot). Therefore, the most specific variant that fits this scenario includes capacity (C), time window constraints (TW), and distance limits (L).

Description: An e-scooter company operates a battery swap system, delivering charged batteries to low-power stations (<loc_customer>, linehaul demand <demand_linehaul>) and collecting depleted ones (backhaul demand <demand_backhaul>). Electric vans (capacity <capacity>) begin at a charging depot (<loc_depot>), prioritize deliveries, then gather spent batteries. Each route must conclude at a recycling center, with total distance under <distance_limit> km to prevent battery drain during transit.
Reason: The problem description specifies a scenario where vehicles (electric vans) have a capacity limit, there is a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after the linehaul demand, and each route has a total distance limit. The routes do not need to return to the depot but must end at a recycling center, which implies an open route. However, since the specific variant needs to match all these conditions as closely as possible and considering the constraints given, the most fitting variant is VRPBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and Linehaul demands, and includes distance limits. The open nature of the route is less emphasized in the classification options, and no time windows are mentioned, so VRPBL is selected over OVRP variants.

Description: A specialized logistics firm transports lab equipment and field tools to remote research sites (e.g., environmental monitoring stations, archaeological digs). After experiments conclude, the same vehicles must collect used samples, contaminated materials, or equipment for return to the depot. Backhaul pickups cannot occur until all linehaul deliveries are complete, and vehicles must stay under their <capacity> limit for both outbound and return trips. The depot, research sites, equipment weights, and sample/pickup volumes are predefined. Route efficiency is vital to reduce delays and ensure compliance with hazardous material handling protocols.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles must perform backhaul pickups only after all linehaul deliveries are complete, indicating a "B" (backhaul) requirement. It also mentions a <capacity> limit for both outbound and return trips, suggesting a "C" (capacity) constraint. Since there is no mention of open routes, distance limits, or time windows, the most appropriate variant is CVRPB, which stands for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls.

Specialized vans (<capacity>) with temperature-controlled tanks start from a hub (<loc_depot>) and can mix deliveries/pickups freely. Vans stay at the final client site overnight. Routes must prioritize minimal travel time to protect marine life and avoid overloading tanks.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the marine service company deals with both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) which can be mixed freely, indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, the requirement to minimize travel time to protect marine life and avoid overloading tanks suggests the presence of time window constraints to ensure timely and safe delivery/pickup. There is no explicit mention of vehicle distance limits or the need for open routes where vehicles do not return to the depot, thus focusing on mixed backhaul and time windows as key characteristics.

Description: A marine services company delivers repair parts to fishing boats and offshore platforms (<loc_customer>) and retrieves obsolete equipment for recycling. Each customer has a maintenance window (<time_windows>) when crews are available. The service vessels (<capacity>) must deliver parts first (linehaul) before hauling away scrap metal (backhaul). Routes are open-ended, concluding at the final stop to reduce fuel costs. Capacity limits ensure vessels can handle both heavy parts and bulky scrap without overloading.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: the service vessels (capacity), a need to deliver parts first before hauling away scrap (backhaul after linehaul), open-ended routes (open route), and specific maintenance windows for customers (time windows). These characteristics align with the OVRPBLTW variant, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and Time Windows. This variant specifically addresses the requirement for backhaul demands to be met only after all linehaul demands are satisfied, along with having open routes and time window constraints.

Description: A recycling firm delivers empty bins to businesses and collects filled ones weekly. Each client specifies time windows for deliveries and pickups. Trucks must first distribute empty bins (linehaul) before returning to collect the waste (backhaul). Capacity limits depend on bin sizes, and routes cannot exceed a distance threshold to ensure same-day service. The company must coordinate deliveries and pickups to meet business schedules without overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: 1) the need to first deliver empty bins (linehaul) before picking up filled ones (backhaul), which points towards a backhaul requirement, 2) time windows for deliveries and pickups, indicating time window constraints, and 3) a distance threshold not to be exceeded, implying vehicle distance limits. There is no mention of an open route (vehicles not returning to the depot). The capacity constraint is also mentioned but is less specific compared to the other features, so it is not the primary focus here. Given these conditions, VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, Time Windows, and Distance Limits, is the most appropriate variant.

Research vessels depart from a coastal depot (<loc_depot>) with a maximum capacity of <capacity> kg. Each station (<loc_customer>) requires equipment delivery (linehaul) followed by data pickup (backhaul). Deployments must occur before pickups to ensure instruments are operational. Time windows (<time_windows>) align with tidal conditions and daylight, with service time (<service_time>) for setup/data transfer. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> nautical mile limit due to fuel constraints, ending at the final station or depot after pickups while respecting capacity limits.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the research vessels have a maximum capacity, must adhere to time windows due to tidal conditions and daylight, and have distance limits due to fuel constraints. Additionally, it is required that deployments (linehaul) occur before pickups (backhaul), meaning backhaul demand can only be satisfied after linehaul demands are met. This combination of requirements for capacity, time windows, distance limits, and backhaul operations aligns with the VRPBLTW variant.

Routes must optimize the sequence of deliveries and pickups while adhering to distance constraints (<distance_limit> km) in remote areas.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: the trucks have a weight limit (capacity), must complete routes within daylight hours (time windows), and there are distance constraints in remote areas. Additionally, the service involves both delivering replacement parts (linehaul) and retrieving defective panels (backhaul). The requirement to first satisfy linehaul demand before backhaul aligns with the "B" (backhaul) characteristic. The presence of time windows for service and distance limits further narps the choice towards VRPBLTW.

Description: A furniture retailer operates a "trade-in" program where customers receive new furniture deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) and simultaneously have old furniture picked up (<demand_backhaul>). Delivery trucks start from the main warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering new items to households, then collecting discarded furniture from other customers. The trucks must never exceed their weight capacity (<capacity>), and pickups can only occur after all deliveries on the route are finalized. The challenge is to balance load distribution and route efficiency to reduce total driving distance while ensuring timely service for both delivery and recycling requests.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks must first deliver new items (linehaul) and then pick up old furniture (backhaul), with pickups only occurring after all deliveries on the route are completed. This clearly indicates a backhaul demand feature ("B"). Additionally, there is a mention of weight capacity for the trucks, which aligns with the "C" (capacity) attribute. Since the backhaul can only happen after all linehaul demands are met, it specifically fits into the VRPB variant. The description does not indicate open routes, distance limits, or time window constraints, so these attributes ("O", "L", "TW") are not applicable here.

The objective is to plan routes that meet all time windows, ensure no truck overloads, and minimize total driving distance to keep the production schedule on track.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each filming location has a strict start time for shooting, which translates to time window constraints (TW). Additionally, the trucks have a capacity limit and must not overload. The routes are planned from a central warehouse to the final location, indicating closed routes (not open). There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, nor any specific distance limits for the vehicles beyond minimizing total driving distance.

The vehicle’s capacity (<capacity>) must accommodate both outbound medication and inbound returns, with routes planned so that deliveries always precede pickups. Missed time windows risk patient dissatisfaction or regulatory penalties for improper medication handling.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicle has a capacity constraint, deliveries (linehaul) must always precede pickups (backhaul), and there are time window constraints for when patients are available. This means we need to consider both "MB" for mixed backhaul, as both types of demand can be satisfied simultaneously, and "TW" for the time windows. The capacity constraint is implied but not specifically required in the variant selection since it is assumed with other features. Thus, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBTW.

Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile testing units that visit neighborhoods (<loc_customer>) to conduct COVID-19 tests. Each unit starts from a central depot (<loc_depot>) with a limited capacity (<capacity>) for test kits and personal protective equipment (<demand_linehaul>). After testing, the units collect biohazard waste (<demand_backhaul>) from clinics or testing sites. Vehicles can sequence deliveries and pickups in any order (e.g., restocking a clinic before collecting waste elsewhere). Drivers end their routes at the final stop without returning to the depot, minimizing unnecessary travel. The goal is to optimize routes to serve all locations while respecting vehicle capacity and minimizing total distance.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles starting from a central depot, having limited capacity for supplies (linehaul demand), and collecting biohazard waste (backhaul demand) with the condition that backhaul can occur only after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, the routes are open, meaning drivers do not return to the depot at the end of their route. There is no mention of distance limits or time windows, which rules out variants including "L" or "TW". The most fitting variant under these conditions is OVRPB, as it accounts for an open route, vehicle capacity, and the specific order requirement for handling linehaul and backhaul demands.

Description: During multi-sport events, mobile laundry units visit athlete housing (<loc_customer>) to collect dirty uniforms (<demand_backhaul>) and deliver cleaned ones (<demand_linehaul>). Vehicles (capacity <capacity>) operate within tight time windows (<time_windows>) between training sessions. Routes terminate near competition venues to prepare for next-day logistics.
Reason: The problem description specifies that vehicles have to operate within tight time windows, which corresponds to the 'TW' attribute. Additionally, it mentions both linehaul (delivering cleaned uniforms) and backhaul (collecting dirty uniforms) demands, with no indication that backhaul can only be satisfied after all linehaul is completed; this suggests a mixed backhaul scenario, fitting the 'MB' attribute. The capacity of the vehicles is also mentioned, but since we already have more specific attributes ('MB' and 'TW'), the 'C' for capacity is not necessary in the variant name. There's no mention of open routes or distance limits for the vehicles, so 'O' and 'L' are not included.

Description: A mobile library service delivers requested books to remote communities and collects returned materials. Vehicles start from a central depot <loc_depot>, carrying a maximum of <capacity> books. Deliveries to remote locations must precede pickups of returned books to optimize space. Each stop has a time window <time_windows> aligned with community availability (e.g., school hours, market days). The goal is to minimize travel distance while adhering to patron schedules and ensuring returned books are collected efficiently without overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: a capacity constraint on the number of books that can be carried, a requirement for deliveries to precede pickups (indicating mixed backhaul where both linehaul and backhaul demands are satisfied simultaneously), and time window constraints aligned with community availability. Since the problem does not specify open routes or vehicle distance limits, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBTW which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows.

Description: A national art gallery network ships new exhibits (<demand_linehaul>) to regional galleries (<loc_customer>) from a storage facility (<loc_depot>) while retrieving loaned artworks (<demand_backhaul>). Fragile cargo limits vehicle capacity to <capacity>. Routes must end at the last gallery (open routes), with a <distance_limit> km constraint to minimize vibration damage during transit.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles have a distance limit, which corresponds to "L". It also mentions that there is both linehaul (shipping new exhibits) and backhaul (retrieving loaned artworks) demand, with the backhaul happening after the linehaul, indicating a "B" type of requirement. Additionally, the routes do not need to return to the depot but end at the last gallery, which matches the "O" open route characteristic. Since the problem includes open routes ("O"), backhaul ("B"), and distance limits ("L"), the most fitting variant from the list is "OVRPBL".

Description: A health organization needs to deliver temperature-sensitive vaccines to rural clinics, each with a specific delivery time window (TW) to ensure they can be administered immediately. Vaccines must be kept at precise temperatures (cold chain), so delivery trucks have limited capacity (C) for refrigerated units. Routes must be completed within a maximum distance (L) to prevent delays and maintain vaccine efficacy. The task is to design routes that meet all clinics’ time windows, adhere to truck capacity and route distance constraints, while minimizing travel costs and ensuring vaccine integrity.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks have limited capacity (C) for refrigerated units, each clinic has a specific delivery time window (TW), and routes must be completed within a maximum distance (L). There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, nor is there an indication that the routes are open (not returning to the depot). Therefore, the most fitting variant from the provided list is VRPBLTW, which accounts for capacity, time windows, and distance limits.

Description: After an earthquake, satellite dishes, repeaters, and emergency radios must be deployed to disconnected regions. Rescue teams (<loc_depot>) dispatch trucks carrying limited payloads (<capacity> kg) to set up communication hubs at designated sites (<loc_customer>). Each site has a critical time window (<time_window>) to align with relief coordination meetings. Trucks cannot exceed a daily distance limit (<distance_limit> km) due to unstable road conditions. Once equipment is unloaded, vehicles remain at the site to aid repairs (O). The task is to plan routes that balance equipment delivery speed, payload constraints, and terrain accessibility while meeting all time windows.
Reason: The problem description includes several key constraints: limited payload (capacity), a daily distance limit for the trucks, and critical time windows that must be met. Additionally, it is mentioned that after unloading, vehicles remain at the site to aid repairs, indicating an open route where vehicles do not return to the depot. These specific conditions match the variant VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Capacity, Distance Limit, and Time Window constraints, and also being an Open route.

Description: During wildfire season, a wildfire management team must deploy fire suppression equipment to <num_customer> hotspots. Each location (<loc_customer>) has a critical response window (<time_windows>) based on wind patterns and terrain. Trucks (<capacity> m³ capacity) carry water pumps, hoses, and tools but cannot exceed their space limits. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius to ensure rapid deployment, and crews remain stationed at the last site to assist firefighters. The priority is to meet time-sensitive delivery deadlines while managing capacity and distance constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes several key constraints: the trucks have a capacity limit, there are critical response windows (time windows) for each location, and routes must stay within a certain distance radius. The variant VRPMBLTW covers mixed backhaul (though not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred from the need to manage various types of equipment), capacity, limited distance, and time windows, which aligns well with the described scenario. However, since mixed backhaul is not directly mentioned and may not be necessary, the most fitting variant without over-specifying would be VRPTW if we consider only the clearly stated requirements (capacity, time windows, and distance limits). But given that "L" (distance limit) is a clear requirement, VRPLTW is more appropriate as it covers both time windows and distance limits along with the inherent capacity constraint in VRP.

Description: A professional sports league requires rapid deployment of specialized equipment (e.g., goal posts, scoring systems, and crowd barriers) to temporary venues for high-profile matches. Each venue has precise time windows for setup before game start times. After the events, the same vehicles must collect all equipment and return it to the central warehouse. Deliveries must precede pickups to avoid mixing loads, and routes must account for strict venue access times and equipment weight limits.
Reason: The problem description includes specific time windows for setup and teardown, as well as the need to respect strict venue access times, which aligns with the "TW" (time window constraints) attribute. Additionally, there is a requirement for deliveries to precede pickups, and each vehicle must return to the central warehouse after collecting all equipment, indicating a closed route. The scenario also mentions capacity considerations (equipment weight limits), but this is a default characteristic of many VRP variants unless otherwise specified. Since no open routes, backhaul, or distance limits are specifically required, the most fitting variant is VRPTW, which incorporates time window constraints.

- Stay within each truck’s capacity limits.  
- Allow drivers to end their routes at the final venue.  
- Reduce total travel distance to cut costs and ensure all equipment arrives on time.
Reason: The problem specifies that each truck has a capacity limit, and the goal is to minimize the total travel distance. There are no mentions of backhaul (B), open routes (O), vehicle distance limits (L), or time windows (TW).

Vehicles (<capacity>) must operate within restaurant delivery windows (<time_windows>) and adhere to a maximum route duration (<distance_limit>) to ensure produce freshness. Deliveries (produce) and pickups (compost) can be interleaved, e.g., a vehicle might drop off lettuce at one location before picking up compost at another.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles have a capacity limit, there are time window constraints for deliveries (produce) and pickups (compost), and the vehicles must adhere to a maximum route duration. Additionally, the scenario involves both linehaul (deliveries of produce) and backhaul (pickups of compost) activities, which can be interleaved.

Deliveries must precede pickups to prevent cross-contamination. Each vehicle routes between sites, starting with equipment delivery before handling pickups. Capacity <capacity> limits require balancing the weight of new equipment and returning waste. The depot and research sites are located at <locs>, with delivery demands <demand_linehaul> and contaminated material pickups <demand_backhaul>. The focus is on efficient routing without compromising safety protocols.
Reason: The problem description specifies that deliveries (linehaul) must precede pickups (backhaul), and there are capacity constraints for the vehicles. Additionally, it mentions balancing the weight of new equipment and returning waste, indicating a need to consider both linehaul and backhaul demands simultaneously. The presence of these conditions points towards a Mixed Backhaul (MB) scenario. Since no specific mention is made of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or time window constraints (TW), the most fitting variant without those additional features is VRPMB, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul.

Description: A staffing agency transports temporary workers to event venues (linehaul) and retrieves them post-shift (backhaul). Workers must arrive at venues precisely during setup windows (<time_windows>), and pickups occur after events end. Buses (<capacity> passengers) cannot operate beyond a 10-hour daily limit (<duration_limit>). Routes must prioritize venue drop-offs before staff pickups, avoiding overtime penalties while minimizing idle time between stops.
Reason: The problem description specifies that workers must be transported to venues during specific setup windows and picked up after events, which aligns with time window constraints (TW). Additionally, the requirement for buses to operate within a 10-hour daily limit can be interpreted as a duration limit, though this is more about operational hours than distance, so it does not directly correspond to an "L" in the variants. The scenario also involves backhaul (picking up workers after the event), but only after all linehaul (transporting workers to the venue) demands are met, fitting the "B" criterion. There is no indication that the routes are open or that the vehicles do not return to a depot, hence "O" is not applicable. Capacity ("C") is mentioned but is overridden by the presence of TW and B. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBTW.

Rugged vehicles (capacity <capacity>) start at a research hub (<loc_depot>), deliver supplies first, then collect samples. Routes must not exceed <distance_limit> km to ensure fuel sufficiency in isolated terrains and end at a sample processing lab.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles start at a research hub, deliver supplies (linehaul demand), then collect biological samples (backhaul demand) before ending at a sample processing lab, which suggests an open route. Additionally, there is a need to satisfy both linehaul and backhaul demands, fitting the mixed backhaul (MB) criteria. The presence of a distance limit (<distance_limit>) for the routes to ensure fuel sufficiency points to the 'L' constraint. Since the problem does not mention any time window constraints, the variant 'OVRPMBL' (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Distance Limit) is the most specific match.

Description: A research organization must deliver specialized equipment (e.g., sensors, lab gear) to remote field sites for environmental studies. Each site has a strict time window for equipment delivery (due to permit restrictions) and a later pickup window after the study concludes. Vehicles must first deliver equipment (linehaul) before collecting unused/used items (backhaul). Each truck has a capacity limit to ensure it doesn’t overload. The goal is to minimize travel distance while respecting time windows and capacity constraints, with routes ending at the final pickup location.
Reason: The problem description includes several key elements: 1) Each vehicle has a capacity limit, 2) There are strict time windows for delivery and pickup, 3) The task involves both linehaul (delivering equipment) and backhaul (collecting unused/used items), with the requirement that all deliveries must be completed before starting pickups.

Starting from a riverside depot (<loc_depot>), routes must serve <num_customer> docks (<loc_customer>) in any order while adhering to a <distance_limit> nautical mile constraint per boat due to fuel efficiency. Boats remain at their final docking point after completing collections.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the boats have a distance limit per route, indicating an "L" (distance limits) attribute. Additionally, it mentions that the boats collect organic waste for composting after supplying fresh produce, which indicates a "B" (backhaul demand) attribute, where backhaul can only occur after all linehaul demand is met. The problem also states that boats do not return to the depot, implying an "O" (open route) feature. However, there is no mention of time window constraints, so the "TW" is not applicable. Considering these attributes, the most fitting variant is OVRPB, as it encompasses open routes, backhaul demands, and does not require the vehicle to return to the depot.

Description: Event organizers deliver stage equipment (lights, audio systems) to venues (linehaul) before setup deadlines and retrieve it after events (backhaul). Venues enforce strict time windows for equipment access, often aligning with load-in/load-out schedules. Trucks must first deliver gear without overloading, then return later to collect it within the teardown window, balancing capacity for both outbound and inbound loads.
Reason: The problem description indicates the presence of backhaul (retrieving equipment after events) and linehaul (delivering equipment before setup deadlines) demands, with strict time windows for equipment access. This means both linehaul and backhaul demands need to be managed within specific time frames, fitting the definition of a VRP with mixed backhaul and time window constraints. The "B" in the variant denotes that backhaul demand can only be satisfied once all linehaul demand is met, which aligns with the requirement to first deliver gear and then return later to collect it. The "TW" indicates that there are time window constraints, as mentioned by the user. There is no mention of open routes or distance limits, so variants including "O" or "L" do not apply here.

Vessels must also adhere to a <distance_limit> nautical mile limit to ensure safe return to the base port (<loc_depot>) without refueling. The challenge is optimizing routes to cover all stations and cleanup sites efficiently while balancing cargo weight and avoiding overreach of travel limits.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: the need to balance cargo weight (capacity), a requirement for equipment deployment (linehaul) before waste collection (backhaul) indicating backhaul demand can only be satisfied after linehaul, and a nautical mile limit (distance limits). There is no mention of open routes or time window constraints.

Routes are capped at 200 km (L) to comply with environmental trucking regulations. Vehicles end at the last site visited (O), reducing fuel waste.
Reason: The problem description includes several key elements: 1) the presence of both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (waste collection) operations, 2) a capacity constraint for each truck, 3) distance limits on the routes, 4) time window constraints for deliveries and waste pickups, and 5) an open route where vehicles do not return to the depot.

Reason: The problem description specifies that each service truck has a capacity limit, the total battery load (fresh + depleted) should not exceed this capacity, and there is a distance limit for each route. Additionally, it mentions both linehaul (supplying fresh batteries) and backhaul (collecting depleted batteries) demands at each station, with the backhaul demand being met after the linehaul demand. These conditions point towards a variant that includes capacity, backhaul, and distance limits. Since there is no mention of open routes or time windows, and given the specific condition that backhaul can only be satisfied after linehaul, VRPBL best fits the described scenario.

Description: A county library system operates mobile units that deliver books to rural communities (<loc_customer>) and collect donated books for redistribution. Each vehicle (capacity <capacity>) starts at the central library (<loc_depot>), visits stops in any order (MB), and ends at the final community (O). Stops have time windows (<time_windows>) for when schools/community centers are open. Deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) include new books, while pickups (<demand_backhaul>) are donations. Routes must respect vehicle capacity and time windows to maximize access.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles have a capacity limit, there are time windows for when stops can be made, and both linehaul (deliveries of new books) and backhaul (collection of donated books) demands need to be satisfied. The route is open, as the vehicle ends at the final community rather than returning to the depot. These features best match the VRPMBLTW variant, which includes mixed backhaul, time window constraints, and an open route.

Description: A port authority must deliver spare parts and supplies (linehaul) to cargo ships during their limited port stay (TW) while simultaneously collecting empty containers (backhaul) for redistribution. Vessels impose strict time windows for service, and port regulations enforce distance limits (L) on truck routes to prevent congestion. Vehicles start at the central depot (O), deliver to ships first, then retrieve containers, never returning to the depot. Each truck’s capacity (C) must accommodate both outbound supplies and inbound containers without overloading.
Reason: The problem description indicates several key attributes: the need for an open route (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, strict time windows (TW) for service, and distance limits (L) on truck routes. Additionally, it specifies a mixed backhaul scenario (MB), where trucks must deliver supplies (linehaul) and then collect empty containers (backhaul) within the same trip, with capacity constraints (C) applying to both types of cargo. Since all these elements are present, the most specific variant that encompasses all these features is OVRPMBLTW.

Description: A network of aquatic farms (<loc_customer>) requires periodic delivery of liquid nutrients (<demand_linehaul>) and collection of mature crops (<demand_backhaul>). Service boats (<capacity>) launch from a riverside depot (<loc_depot>), interleaving supply and harvest tasks as needed. Daily routes cannot exceed <distance_limit> nautical miles due to fuel tank limitations, with boats docking at the last visited farm.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the service boats have a distance limit (<distance_limit>) and that they must interleave supply (linehaul) and harvest (backhaul) tasks, implying that both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously. This aligns with the "MB" for mixed backhaul and "L" for distance limits. There is no mention of time windows or open routes, which rules out "TW" and "O" variants. Therefore, the most fitting variant is VRPMBL, capturing mixed backhaul and distance constraints.

Description: A research team uses vessels to deploy sensors (<demand_linehaul>) at oceanic sites (<loc_customer>) and retrieve malfunctioning equipment (<demand_backhaul>). Vessels depart from a coastal base (<loc_depot>) with a cargo hold capacity of <capacity> tons. Due to fuel limits, each route must stay under <distance_limit> nautical miles. Sensor deployments and equipment pickups can occur in any order.
Reason: The problem specifies that vessels have a cargo hold capacity, which indicates a capacity constraint (C). Additionally, there is a backhaul demand for retrieving malfunctioning equipment, and this must be done after all linehaul demands (sensor deployments) are satisfied, indicating a backhaul (B) requirement. The distance limit for each route due to fuel constraints also introduces a distance limit (L) aspect. Since the problem does not mention any time window constraints or an open route where the vessel does not return to the depot, the most fitting variant is VRPBL.

Trucks have fixed payload limits (<capacity>), and after unloading at the final venue, they remain on-site to support setup. The challenge is to route trucks so they never exceed capacity while covering all locations, minimizing total distance driven.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks have fixed payload limits (capacity) and the goal is to cover all locations while minimizing the total distance driven. There is no mention of backhaul, distance limits for vehicles, open routes, or time windows. Therefore, the most fitting variant is CVRP, which stands for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, focusing on the capacity constraint without the additional features mentioned in other variants.

Description: Manufacturing companies need to deliver specialized tools to factories (<loc_customer>) and collect scrap metal for recycling. Trucks depart from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering tools (linehaul), then picking up scrap (backhaul). Each vehicle has a <capacity> kg limit and must stay within a <distance_limit> km route to minimize fuel costs. The goal is to optimize routes so deliveries precede pickups, vehicles finish at the last stop, and all factories are serviced without overloading.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks must first deliver tools (linehaul) and then pick up scrap (backhaul), with the condition that deliveries precede pickups. Additionally, each vehicle has a capacity limit and a distance limit to minimize fuel costs. Since the backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, and there is a distance limit for each vehicle, the most appropriate variant is VRPBL. The "B" in VRPBL indicates the backhaul condition, and "L" stands for the distance limit. There is no mention of open routes or time windows, so variants with "O" or "TW" do not apply.

Description: A mobile pet grooming company operates a fleet of vans that provide grooming services at customers' homes (<loc_customer>) and collect pet waste for eco-friendly disposal. Each van has a capacity (<capacity>) for grooming supplies and waste containers. Appointments must be scheduled within strict time windows (<time_windows>) to accommodate pet owners' availability. The vans must also return to the depot (<loc_depot>) before exceeding their maximum daily operating hours (<distance_limit>). Deliveries (grooming) and pickups (waste) can be interleaved in any order along routes.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each van has a capacity for grooming supplies and waste containers, which corresponds to the "C" (capacity) feature. It also specifies strict time windows for appointments, aligning with the "TW" (time window constraints) feature. Additionally, there is a mention of maximum daily operating hours, which can be interpreted as a distance or time limit on the routes, fitting the "L" (distance limits) feature. The requirement for vans to return to the depot suggests that this is not an open route, thus excluding any variant starting with "O". Given these features, the most specific variant that matches the described scenario is VRPBLTW, considering capacity, distance limits, and time window constraints.

Routes must stay within a daily distance limit (<distance_limit>) to allow teams to return to the central command center nightly for updates. The challenge is to plan routes that minimize downtime while respecting capacity and distance constraints.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vans have limited space (capacity), each site has a strict service window (time windows), and there is a daily distance limit for the routes. The requirement for teams to return to the central command center nightly indicates that this is not an open route. There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, so the most fitting variant is VRPTW, which includes time window constraints.

Description: A tech firm deploys environmental sensors (linehaul) to farms to monitor crop health and later retrieves data storage modules (backhaul). Farmers require sensor installation during daylight hours (8 AM-5 PM) and data retrieval within 24 hours to prevent data overflow. Each sensor has a weight/dimensions limit, and retrieval modules must be collected after deployment. The firm’s vans have a capacity constraint, and routes must conclude at the final farm to optimize fuel use.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key constraints: capacity (vans have a capacity constraint), backhaul (data storage modules must be collected after deployment, and this can only happen once the sensors are installed), and time windows (sensors need to be installed during daylight hours 8 AM-5 PM, and data retrieval must occur within 24 hours). There is no indication of open routes or distance limits for the vehicles. Given these specific requirements, the most fitting variant that encompasses all these aspects is VRPBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows.

Description: A beverage company maintains coolers in convenience stores, delivering fresh drinks and retrieving empty bottles. Trucks (`<capacity>`) depart from `<loc_depot>` to visit `<num_customer>` stores (`<loc_customer>`). Each store may need restocking (`<demand_linehaul>`) or have empties to collect (`<demand_backhaul>`). Routes must balance deliveries and pickups dynamically, ensuring capacity limits are respected and drivers conclude routes at their last stop.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the trucks have a capacity limit, and they are required to handle both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) dynamically. This implies that both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, pointing towards a mixed backhaul scenario. There is no mention of open routes, distance limits for vehicles, or time window constraints, which leads us to select the variant with "MB" (Mixed Backhaul) as the key feature, making VRPMB the most appropriate classification.

Description: A museum consortium needs to deploy temporary exhibits across multiple locations, delivering fragile artifacts and display materials to galleries with strict setup deadlines. Each truck has a <capacity> kg limit for transporting delicate items. After exhibitions conclude, crews must retrieve all materials for redistribution. Routes must first deliver exhibits within each gallery’s <time_window> installation window, then return to collect items post-event—without returning to the central depot. Service times at each location (<service_time>) include careful setup and teardown processes, requiring precise timing to avoid delays.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each truck has a capacity limit for transporting delicate items, which corresponds to the "C" (capacity) attribute. It also mentions strict setup deadlines and time windows for installation, which aligns with the "TW" (time window constraints) attribute. Additionally, the requirement for routes to not return to the central depot after completing their tasks matches the "O" (open route) characteristic. The scenario involves delivering exhibits first and then retrieving them, indicating a mixed backhaul situation where both linehaul (delivering) and backhaul (collecting) demands are present, matching the "MB" (mixed backhaul) feature. However, since "MB" includes both "B" (backhaul) and linehaul aspects, and considering the presence of "O", "TW", and the inherent "C" (as a base), the most specific variant is OVRPMBTW.

Delivery vehicles (capacity <capacity> kg) must first distribute the kits before collecting returned packaging. Routes originate from a central kitchen (<loc_depot>), end at the last customer stop, and cannot exceed <distance_limit> km to maintain freshness and fuel efficiency. The challenge is to balance load capacity, prioritize delivery before retrieval, and optimize route lengths across multiple trucks.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the delivery vehicles have a capacity constraint, must first distribute (linehaul) before collecting returned packaging (backhaul), and there is a distance limit for each route. The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, which matches the "B" (backhaul) condition. Additionally, the distance limit for maintaining freshness and fuel efficiency corresponds to the "L" (distance limits) condition. There is no mention of open routes or time windows, so those attributes are not included.

Description: A home appliance retailer delivers new appliances (e.g., refrigerators) to customers (<loc_customer>) and collects old appliances for recycling. Delivery trucks depart from the warehouse (<loc_depot>), first completing all linehaul deliveries (new appliances) before picking up recyclables (backhaul). Each truck’s capacity (<capacity>) limits total load. Routes finish at the final recycling pickup location, optimizing fuel use and reducing operational expenses.
Reason: The problem description mentions a scenario where delivery trucks first complete all linehaul deliveries (new appliances) before picking up recyclables (backhaul). This indicates a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all the linehaul demand is met. Additionally, the mention of each truck’s capacity limits the total load, which is a characteristic of the CVRP. However, since the backhaul condition is more specific and present, and there are no indications of open routes, distance limits for vehicles, or time window constraints, the most appropriate variant is VRPB (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls).

Time windows (<time_windows>) are strict due to parking regulations. Vans end routes at their final stop without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem description indicates an open route (vans do not return to the depot), backhaul demand (collecting spent batteries after delivering fresh ones, with a condition that all linehaul demands must be met first), and strict time windows due to parking regulations. Since the capacity is also mentioned but is not the primary constraint given the other attributes, we prioritize 'O', 'B', and 'TW'. The most fitting variant that includes these features is OVRPBTW.

Temperature-controlled trucks (C) must carry only specific toolsets due to payload restrictions and end their journeys at the final destination (O) to ensure equipment stability. The challenge is to synchronize deliveries across time zones while avoiding overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem description specifies a narrow 1-hour window for installation, which aligns with the "TW" (time window) attribute. Additionally, there are payload restrictions ("C" for capacity), and the requirement to avoid overloading vehicles suggests a need to consider vehicle capacity. However, since "TW" is a more specific and constraining feature in this context, it takes precedence over "C".

Deliveries must occur before pickups to stock the kiosks adequately. Each vehicle has a capacity limit. Kiosk locations have setup time windows (to align with event schedules) and pickup deadlines after the promotion ends. The objective is to optimize routes for minimal distance, ensuring capacity constraints are met, with vehicles finishing at the last pickup point.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each vehicle has a capacity limit, which aligns with the "C" attribute. Additionally, there are time windows for both setup and pickup at kiosks, matching the "TW" (time window) attribute. The need to deliver inventory before pickups suggests a backhaul situation, but since deliveries must occur before pickups, this points more specifically towards a mixed backhaul scenario where linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, fitting the "MB" attribute. Given these specific requirements, VRPMBTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows) is the most appropriate variant as it encompasses all the mentioned constraints: capacity, mixed backhaul, and time windows.

✓ Plan routes starting from your depot (<loc_depot>) to drop off containers at client locations (<loc_customer>).  
✓ Ensure no truck exceeds its weight capacity.  
✓ Let drivers conclude their shifts at the final drop-off point.  
Efficient routing reduces transportation costs and guarantees quick service for clients needing space solutions.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks have a payload limit and must not exceed this weight capacity, which aligns with the "C" (capacity) feature. Additionally, it mentions planning routes from a depot to drop off containers at client locations, and ensuring no truck exceeds its weight capacity, without any mention of backhaul, distance limits for vehicles, or time windows. The requirement for drivers to conclude their shifts at the final drop-off point suggests an open route ("O") where the vehicles do not return to the depot after completing deliveries. However, since the "O" variant is typically used in conjunction with other constraints like "B", "L", or "TW" and none are explicitly mentioned, the most fitting variant remains focused on the capacity constraint, making CVRP (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem) the most appropriate classification.

Description: A grocery wholesaler supplies fresh produce to urban markets (<loc_customer>) and collects organic waste (e.g., expired goods, compost) for disposal. Trucks (<capacity>) must first deliver perishables to ensure freshness, then backtrack to gather waste. The distance limit (<distance_limit>) ensures routes remain short enough to maintain food quality and prevent spoilage en route. Capacity constraints require balancing the weight of outbound produce and inbound waste to avoid overloading.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key aspects: capacity constraints, backtracking to collect waste after delivering produce (indicating backhaul), and a distance limit for routes. The mixed backhaul feature is also implied since the trucks must balance the weight of both outbound produce and inbound waste simultaneously. There is no mention of open routes or time windows, so these are not considered.

Routes must stay within a distance limit (<distance_limit>) to ensure blood stays refrigerated and units return to the depot for restocking.
Reason: The problem description includes capacity constraints for the bloodmobiles, a distance limit for the routes to ensure blood stays refrigerated, and time window constraints to align with hospital shift schedules. There is no mention of backhaul or open routes, which simplifies the selection to a variant that specifically includes capacity, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: An office supply retailer delivers printer cartridges, paper, and stationery (linehaul) to businesses. In return, customers provide empty ink cartridges, cardboard boxes, and plastic packaging (backhaul) for recycling. Delivery trucks must first complete all supply drops before collecting recyclables to prevent contamination. Each vehicle’s capacity (<capacity>) must balance the weight of new items and returned materials. Routes end at the final collection point, ensuring drivers do not backtrack to the depot. The focus is on reducing fuel costs and maximizing recycling efficiency without overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem specifies that backhaul (collecting recyclables) can only occur after all linehaul (deliveries) are completed, indicating a "B" (backhaul) characteristic. The problem also emphasizes balancing the capacity of vehicles with both new items and returned materials, which aligns with the "C" (capacity) aspect. However, since "B" is more specific and "C" is considered when other features are not present, we focus on "B".

Each vehicle can carry up to <capacity> kg and must complete its route within <distance_limit> kilometers to conserve fuel. Deliveries must occur before sample pickups to ensure researchers have tools for collection. Routes terminate at the last sampling site, minimizing redundant travel.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles must deliver field equipment and food (linehaul) before collecting soil/water samples (backhaul), with a capacity limit for each vehicle, and a distance limit for the route. The routes terminate at the last sampling site, indicating an open route as the vehicles do not return to the depot. Since the linehaul demand must be satisfied before the backhaul, this fits the "B" (backhaul) characteristic. There are no specific time window constraints mentioned, so "TW" is not applicable.

Once a truck completes its final task—whether dropping a crane or collecting scrap—it remains parked at the terminal to await further assignments, adhering to open-route requirements.
Reason: The problem description includes several key elements: there are strict time windows for port berths, varying weights for cranes (linehaul) and scrap (backhaul) requiring load balancing, and the requirement that trucks do not return to a depot after completing their final task. These characteristics point towards an open route (O), mixed backhaul (MB) where both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, and time window (TW) constraints.

Description: A medical supply company delivers diagnostic kits and medical devices to clinics while collecting biohazard waste for disposal. Deliveries of medical equipment must be completed before waste pickups. Each vehicle has a strict capacity limit, requiring careful balancing of outbound supplies and inbound hazardous materials. Routes terminate at the final waste collection point, with the goal of minimizing travel costs and ensuring regulatory compliance for waste handling.
Reason: The problem description indicates that deliveries (linehaul) must be completed before waste pickups (backhaul), suggesting a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands. The capacity of the vehicles is also a key constraint, and there is an emphasis on minimizing travel costs and ensuring regulatory compliance, which could imply time window constraints for specific operations like waste handling. However, since the core requirement is the sequential nature of linehaul and backhaul operations, the most fitting variant is VRPB, where B stands for backhaul demand which can be satisfied only when all the linehaul demand is satisfied. No explicit mention of open routes or distance limits was made, so these are not included in the classification.

Description: A farm services company delivers pesticides (linehaul) to rural farms during planting windows (TW) and collects empty containers (backhaul) for recycling. Trucks (C) must handle hazardous materials carefully, adhering to strict capacity limits. Routes are limited by distance (L) to cover remote areas efficiently. Drivers begin at the depot, supply pesticides, then retrieve containers, concluding at the depot for recycling—preventing environmental contamination and reducing travel redundancy.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: backhaul (B) for collecting empty containers, distance limits (L) for covering remote areas efficiently, and time windows (TW) for delivering pesticides during planting windows. The capacity (C) is also a factor due to the strict capacity limits for handling hazardous materials. However, since C is considered as part of the base VRP when other features like B, L, and TW are present, it is not explicitly included in the variant name. Additionally, the routes are closed, meaning they start and end at the depot, which excludes the "O" (open route) variants. Therefore, the most appropriate variant that matches all these specific conditions is VRPBLTW.

Description: A research supply company delivers specialized lab equipment to remote research facilities and collects hazardous biological or chemical samples for analysis. Each van (capacity <capacity>) departs from the central lab (<loc_depot>), first delivering equipment to remote sites, then collecting samples from those same locations. The backhaul phase must occur only after all deliveries are finalized to avoid contamination or equipment damage. The goal is to minimize travel distance while ensuring sample integrity and adherence to safety protocols.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vans have a capacity, which is denoted by "C". Additionally, it specifies a clear backhaul requirement where the collection of hazardous samples (backhaul) must occur only after all deliveries (linehaul) are completed, fitting the "B" classification. There is no mention of open routes, distance limits for vehicles, or specific time windows for service. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPB, as it captures both the capacity and the backhaul requirements without adding unnecessary constraints.

Description: A global satellite operator must deploy communication equipment to remote ground stations and retrieve outdated gear for recycling. Trucks depart from a central depot to deliver new equipment (linehaul) before collecting old units (backhaul) to avoid cross-contamination. Each site has strict installation and retrieval time windows tied to satellite orbital passes. Vehicles must complete routes within a 12-hour window (duration limit) to ensure daylight operations, and payloads cannot exceed truck capacities. The challenge is balancing equipment delivery with pickup schedules while adhering to tight operational timelines.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the trucks must deliver new equipment (linehaul) and then collect old units (backhaul), ensuring that backhaul can only occur after all linehaul demands are met, which aligns with the "B" (backhaul) characteristic. Additionally, there are strict time windows for installation and retrieval tied to satellite orbital passes, fitting the "TW" (time window) constraint. The 12-hour operational window and payload capacity limits further support these constraints but do not introduce additional specific variants beyond "B" and "TW".

Description: A catering company supplies multiple food trucks at a citywide festival with fresh ingredients and collects used dishware after each shift. Trucks depart from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>) and must deliver perishable goods (<demand_linehaul>) to vendors by their opening time windows (<time_windows>). After service concludes, they collect reusable dishware (<demand_backhaul>) but must prioritize deliveries first. Each vehicle (<capacity>) must complete all deliveries before pickups, ensuring dishware retrieval doesn’t delay ingredient deliveries. Routes end at the final stop to avoid unnecessary return trips.
Reason: The problem description indicates the presence of time windows for deliveries, backhaul demand (collecting dishware) that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand (delivering ingredients) is met, and a central depot. The routes are not described as open, and there is no mention of distance limits. Thus, the variant that best fits these conditions is VRPBTW, which includes backhaul demands and time window constraints.

Description: Film crews deliver set components (<demand_linehaul>) to filming locations and retrieve reusable materials (<demand_backhaul>). Trucks (<capacity>) depart from a storage depot (<loc_depot>), constrained by <distance_limit> km for same-day operations. Time windows (<time_windows>) align with shooting schedules. Deliveries must precede pickups to avoid disrupting filming. Routes can terminate at the final location or depot after pickups, ensuring materials are returned without exceeding capacity limits.
Reason: The problem description specifies several key attributes: there is a demand for both delivering set components (linehaul) and retrieving reusable materials (backhaul), with the condition that deliveries must precede pickups, implying a backhaul that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there are distance limits for same-day operations, and time windows aligning with shooting schedules. Since the routes can terminate at the final location or return to the depot, this suggests a closed route rather than an open one. The presence of capacity constraints is also mentioned but is considered standard in VRP variants unless otherwise specified. Therefore, considering the need for backhauling, distance limits, and time windows, the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW.

Description: A chain of salad bars requires fresh produce deliveries daily, with each location specifying a delivery time window (TW) to ensure ingredients are fresh for peak service hours. Delivery trucks have limited cargo space (C) for chilled produce, and all deliveries must be completed within a set route distance (L) to avoid delays and spoilage. The task is to optimize routes that adhere to each store’s time window, truck capacity, and route distance constraints while minimizing fuel costs and maximizing on-time deliveries.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each store has a time window (TW) for deliveries, the trucks have limited cargo space (C), and there is a set route distance (L) constraint. The objective is to optimize routes while adhering to these constraints. Since the problem explicitly mentions capacity, time windows, and distance limits, and does not mention open routes or backhaul, the most appropriate variant is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Capacity, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.

Each stop involves both delivering new artworks (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieving previous exhibits (<demand_backhaul>), sequenced flexibly based on gallery schedules (<time_windows>). High-value cargo requires precise timing for security handovers (e.g., 9:00–11:00 AM slots) and strict capacity limits to prevent damage.

Description: A municipal arborist service prunes trees (<loc_customer>) during neighborhood-approved time windows (<time_windows>) and collects branches for composting. Chipper trucks (capacity <capacity>) route dynamically—pruning some trees before collecting debris from others—while adhering to noise ordinance duration limits (<distance_limit>).
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: the capacity of the chipper trucks, adherence to time windows for pruning and noise ordinance, and distance limits due to the noise ordinance. The "C" (capacity) is present but is overridden by the presence of other features. "TW" (time window constraints) is evident from the mention of neighborhood-approved time windows and noise ordinance duration limits. "L" (distance limit) is also specified through the noise ordinance duration limits. There is no indication of backhaul ("B" or "MB") or open routes ("O"). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches this scenario is VRPLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits and Time Windows.

Description: A nonprofit organization needs to deploy portable classrooms to rural schools in remote areas. Trucks depart from a central hub (<loc_depot>) carrying pre-assembled classrooms (<demand_linehaul>), which must be delivered first to designated schools (<loc_customer>). After completing all deliveries, the same trucks collect unused or decommissioned classrooms (<demand_backhaul>) from other schools for redistribution or storage. Each truck has a strict <capacity> limit for both transporting new classrooms and hauling back decommissioned units. Routes must ensure classrooms arrive intact without overloading vehicles, and drivers finish at the final pickup location to avoid unnecessary return trips.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the trucks have a strict capacity limit for transporting new classrooms and hauling back decommissioned units, and that backhaul demand (collection of unused or decommissioned classrooms) can only be satisfied after all linehaul deliveries (new classrooms to schools) are completed. This fits the definition of a VRP with capacity constraints (C) and backhaul (B) requirements, but without explicit mention of distance limits (L), open routes (O), mixed backhaul (MB), or time windows (TW). Thus, the most specific variant that matches this scenario is VRPB, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul.

Description: A city renovation project uses flatbed trucks (capacity <capacity>) to simultaneously deliver new park benches (<demand_linehaul>) and collect broken fixtures (<demand_backhaul>) from various locations (<loc_customer>). Starting from the municipal yard (<loc_depot>), crews complete their workday at the final job site. Routes are limited to <distance_limit> km to ensure 8-hour workday compliance.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the trucks have a capacity, there are both linehaul (delivering new park benches) and backhaul (collecting broken fixtures) demands, and the routes have a distance limit to comply with an 8-hour workday. The requirement for satisfying backhaul demand after all linehaul demand is met suggests a "B" classification, not "MB". Additionally, the fact that the routes do not return to the depot but end at the final job site fits the "O" (open route) characteristic. There is no mention of time window constraints, so "TW" is not included. Thus, combining these attributes, the most appropriate variant is OVRPBL.

Description: A semiconductor manufacturer must deliver specialized components to multiple fabrication plants spread across a region. Each plant has a strict production schedule with time windows during which components must be installed to avoid halting assembly lines. Delivery trucks have a limited capacity to ensure components are not damaged by overloading, and routes must not exceed a daily distance limit to prevent overheating sensitive equipment. The goal is to plan routes that meet all time windows while optimizing fuel efficiency and adhering to vehicle constraints.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks have a limited capacity to ensure components are not damaged (C), and routes must not exceed a daily distance limit to prevent overheating sensitive equipment (L). Additionally, each plant has strict production schedules with time windows during which components must be installed (TW). Since there is no mention of open routes or backhauls, the most fitting variant considering these constraints is VRPBLTW.

Description: A furniture company delivers new items to customers’ homes (<loc_customer>) and collects old furniture for recycling. Deliveries must occur during customers’ specified time windows (<time_windows>), after which the trucks can pick up discarded pieces (<demand_backhaul>). Each vehicle (<capacity> cubic meters) must first complete all deliveries before initiating pickups. Routes are constrained to <distance_limit> km to comply with driver working-hour regulations, ending at the final customer’s location. The challenge is to optimize routes to minimize fuel costs while ensuring timely service and respecting capacity limits.
Reason: The problem description includes specific constraints that align with multiple attributes: backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all deliveries, distance limits for the routes (L), and time window constraints (TW). The capacity constraint (C) is also mentioned but it is a common attribute and does not add to the specificity when other features are present. There is no mention of an open route (O) or mixed backhaul (MB) where both linehaul and backhaul demands can be served simultaneously. Therefore, the most appropriate variant that covers all these aspects is VRPBLTW.

Description: In a riverine community, boats (capacity <capacity>) distribute fresh produce from a central hub (<loc_depot>) to floating markets (<loc_customer>). Each market requires deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) and may return spoiled goods (<demand_backhaul>).  
Boats can sequence deliveries/collections flexibly but must complete routes within <distance_limit> km due to fuel limits. The challenge is to balance inventory turnover and minimize travel time on winding waterways.
Reason: The problem involves boats with a capacity limit, which is covered by "C". There are both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (return of spoiled goods) demands, but the backhaul can only occur after all linehaul deliveries have been made, fitting the "B" criteria. Additionally, there is a distance limit due to fuel constraints, which matches the "L" characteristic. The user did not mention any time window constraints or that the routes must be open, so "TW" and "O" do not apply. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBL, which accounts for capacity, backhaul, and distance limits.

Delivery trucks must first install the new equipment before collecting old parts, respecting <capacity> limits. Routes must not exceed <distance_limit> for fuel efficiency, ending at the final installation site without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem specifies that delivery trucks must first install the new equipment (linehaul) before collecting old parts (backhaul), which indicates a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after linehaul. Additionally, there are capacity limits and a distance limit for fuel efficiency, but no mention of time windows. The route ends at the final installation site without returning to the depot, indicating an open route.

Description: An urban agriculture startup supplies hydroponic nutrients and seedlings (linehaul) to rooftop farms while collecting freshly harvested crops (backhaul) for same-day market delivery. Each farm has a narrow time window for crop collection to maintain freshness, and deliveries must occur during daylight hours. Vehicles cannot exceed a 150km route radius to minimize emissions, with capacity constraints balancing fragile supplies and perishable produce. Routes end at the last farm without returning to the central hub.
Reason: The problem description specifies several key constraints: (1) There are both linehaul (delivering hydroponic nutrients and seedlings) and backhaul (collecting freshly harvested crops) activities, which aligns with the "MB" (mixed backhaul) feature. (2) Each farm has a narrow time window for crop collection, indicating the need for "TW" (time window) constraints. (3) Vehicles cannot exceed a 150km route radius, which is a "L" (distance limit) constraint. (4) Routes end at the last farm without returning to the central hub, suggesting an "O" (open route) characteristic.

After unloading, drivers proceed to collect used equipment from the same route, ensuring no returns are scheduled until all setups are complete. Routes end at the last venue to avoid redundant travel.
Reason: The problem description includes specific time windows for delivery and pickup, capacity constraints for the trucks, and a requirement that backhaul (pickup) can only occur after all linehaul (delivery) is complete. This matches the VRPBTW variant, which accounts for both time window constraints and backhaul demands being satisfied only after all linehaul demands are met.

Routes are constrained by <distance_limit> km to account for urban traffic, ending at the final customer site or depot after pickups. Capacity limits ensure panel and battery loads never exceed truck limits, optimizing urban logistics efficiency.
Reason: The problem description includes linehaul (delivering new panels) and backhaul (collecting used batteries) demands, where the delivery must precede the pickup. It also mentions that each truck has a distance limit and adheres to time windows for building access. The routes start from a warehouse and end at the final customer site or return to the depot after pickups, indicating closed routes. Capacity limits are also mentioned.

Description: During floods, rescue boats transport emergency supplies to stranded communities (linehaul) and later collect hazardous debris for disposal (backhaul). Each boat has limited capacity for both supplies and waste. Routes must ensure supplies are delivered first, then debris collected, without exceeding fuel range (distance limit). Boats end their routes at the furthest debris collection point to minimize redundant travel. The aim is to maximize aid distribution while respecting capacity and range constraints.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the rescue boats have to deliver supplies (linehaul) before collecting hazardous debris (backhaul), and they do not return to the depot but end their routes at the furthest collection point. Additionally, there are capacity limits for both supplies and waste, and a distance limit due to fuel range. These characteristics align with the VRPBL variant, where B stands for backhaul demand following linehaul, L for distance (fuel range) limits, and implicitly C for capacity constraints, which is assumed when other features are present.

Launching from a coastal base (<loc_depot>), routes must cover <num_customer> floating platforms (<loc_customer>) within <distance_limit> km due to battery limits. Drones land on charging stations at their final platform.
Reason: The problem description mentions a capacity constraint for the drones, linehaul demand (delivering cleaning fluid), and backhaul demand (retrieving data loggers) with the condition that backhaul can only occur after linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there is a distance limit for the drones due to battery constraints. The route does not need to return to the depot as the drones land on charging stations at their final platform, indicating an open route. Since the problem includes "B" (backhaul demand), "L" (distance limits), and "O" (open route) features, and "C" (capacity) is ignored when other features are present, the most fitting variant is OVRPBL.

Trucks depart from the blood bank (<loc_depot>), first delivering critical supplies (linehaul) to hospitals within strict time windows (<time_windows>) to match urgent patient needs. Afterward, they collect donated blood (backhaul) from temporary drives at scheduled times. Each refrigerated truck has a capacity (<capacity>) for blood units and must adhere to a distance limit (<distance_limit>) to maintain temperature control. Routes conclude at the final hospital or donation site to prioritize immediate medical needs.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features: capacity (C), backhaul (B) with the condition that it can only occur after all linehaul demands are met, distance limits (L) for the trucks, and strict time windows (TW) for both deliveries and collections. Since the problem specifies backhaul after linehaul, "MB" (mixed backhaul) is not applicable here. The requirement for the routes to conclude at the final hospital or donation site suggests an open route (O). However, given the specific nature of backhauling post-linehauling, the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW, which encapsulates backhaul, distance limits, and time window constraints, without the need for the vehicle to return to the depot as per the open route characteristic. This choice also adheres to the rule that when multiple attributes are present, we prioritize the more specific ones over general ones like "C".

Vehicles must adhere to hotels’ specific time windows for deliveries (e.g., morning setup) and pickups (e.g., evening collection). Each truck has a capacity limit for both clean and dirty linens. Routes are constrained by distance to ensure drivers can complete their assigned stops within a shift without returning to the depot. The goal is to optimize delivery and pickup sequences to meet hotel schedules while avoiding overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: the need to handle both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) simultaneously, the presence of specific time windows for deliveries and pickups, a capacity limit for each truck, and distance constraints to ensure routes can be completed within a shift. The "MB" (mixed backhaul) is applicable since it allows for handling both types of demand without requiring all linehaul demands to be satisfied before backhauls. Additionally, the "TW" (time window) constraint is clearly specified, and "L" (distance limits) are mentioned. However, there is no indication that the routes are open, meaning vehicles do return to the depot, so "O" (open route) does not apply. Thus, combining these, VRPMBLTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Load, and Time Windows) is the most appropriate variant.

Routes conclude at the final customer, streamlining last-mile logistics while adhering to strict customer scheduling preferences.
Reason: The problem description includes specific constraints such as the need for trucks to complete all deliveries (linehaul) before initiating returns (backhaul), which aligns with the "B" backhaul feature. Additionally, it mentions that customers specify time windows for both deliveries and pickups, fitting the "TW" (time window) constraint. Since there is no mention of the vehicles having distance limits ("L") or that the routes are open (not returning to the depot, "O"), and considering the presence of capacity constraints which are subsumed by other features, the most appropriate variant is VRPBTW.

Description: A construction equipment rental firm delivers tools (e.g., drills, generators) to job sites (<demand_linehaul> units) and collects them post-use (<demand_backhaul> units). Rentals require precise route planning: trucks (<capacity> units) must first deliver equipment to active sites (<loc_customer>), then return to pick up returned gear. Each vehicle’s route must not exceed a distance limit (<distance_limit> km) to avoid excessive driving and ensure timely returns to the depot. The challenge is to balance load capacity and route length while minimizing total travel costs.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks have a capacity limit, must first deliver equipment (linehaul) and then return to pick up returned gear (backhaul), and each vehicle’s route must not exceed a distance limit. The requirement for both linehaul and backhaul to be managed with specific attention to the order of operations and the presence of a distance limit for each vehicle points towards a VRP variant that includes capacity, mixed backhaul, and distance limits. There is no mention of time windows or open routes, so variants including "TW" or "O" are excluded. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Distance Limits.

Description: A logistics firm transports fragile, high-value artworks to museums across the city for simultaneous exhibitions. Each artwork has a unique weight (<demand>), and trucks must not exceed their payload capacity (C). Vehicles start at an art storage facility (<loc_depot>) and end at their final delivery point (O). Routes must adhere to strict distance limits (L) to prevent excessive wear on the vehicles and ensure timely deliveries. Museums impose tight time windows (TW) to coordinate with installation crews, demanding precise arrival times to avoid halting exhibition setup.
Reason: The problem description includes capacity constraints (C), distance limits for the vehicles (L), and strict time windows (TW) that must be adhered to. There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, nor is there any indication that the routes are open (vehicles do not return to the depot). Therefore, the most specific variant that fits this description is VRPLTW, which accounts for vehicle capacity, distance limits, and time window constraints.

Description: A grocery retailer delivers fresh produce and dairy items to neighborhood stores (linehaul) while collecting organic waste and compostable packaging from those stores for recycling (backhaul). Time windows are critical to ensure perishables arrive before store opening hours, and waste is collected after closing. Each truck’s capacity must accommodate both deliveries and pickups without exceeding limits. Additionally, routes are restricted to a maximum distance to maintain product freshness and operational efficiency in densely urbanized areas.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key attributes: the need for both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul), with each truck having to manage its capacity to accommodate both, indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, there are critical time windows for delivering perishables before store opening hours and collecting waste after closing, which aligns with the "TW" (time window) attribute. The routes also have a maximum distance limit to maintain product freshness and operational efficiency, which fits the "L" (distance limits) attribute. Given these requirements, the most suitable variant is one that includes mixed backhaul, time window constraints, and distance limits.

Description: A healthcare logistics team delivers vaccines to remote health centers and collects used syringes for disposal. Deliveries (linehaul) of vaccines must precede pickups (backhaul) of medical waste. Each center has time windows for vaccine storage (e.g., before refrigeration failure) and waste pickup (e.g., end of clinic hours). Vehicles have capacity limits for temperature-sensitive supplies and biohazard waste, cannot exceed daily distance constraints, and finish routes at the last location to avoid delays.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple critical features: (1) the need for linehaul deliveries to precede backhaul pickups, indicating a backhaul requirement; (2) time windows for both deliveries and pickups, suggesting time window constraints; (3) vehicle capacity limits for different types of cargo; and (4) daily distance limits. Among the provided variants, VRPBLTW encompasses all these aspects - backhaul (B), linehaul preceding backhaul, time windows (TW), and distance limits (L).

Trucks (capacity: <capacity>) start at a repair center (<loc_depot>) and end routes at the last site. Distance per route is limited to <distance_limit> km to ensure technicians return before nightfall in off-grid areas.
Reason: The problem description mentions the need for trucks to deliver replacement parts (linehaul) and collect faulty panels (backhaul), with a specific condition that backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met. Additionally, there is a distance limit per route to ensure technicians return before nightfall, which indicates a distance constraint. There is no mention of time windows or the need for open routes, so the most appropriate variant is VRPBL.

Description: A sports league delivers equipment to tournament venues (<loc_customer>) using trucks with a <capacity> ton capacity. Each venue has a setup time window <time_windows> for deliveries (linehaul) and a teardown window for pickups (backhaul). Vehicles must first deliver all items within capacity limits before initiating pickups, synchronized with event schedules to avoid delays.
Reason: The problem description mentions specific constraints such as capacity limits, a requirement for backhaul to occur only after all linehaul demands are met, and time windows for both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul). These details align with the characteristics of the VRPBLTW variant, which includes capacity (C), backhaul (B), and time window (TW) constraints. The presence of "setup time window" and "teardown window" clearly indicates the need for time window constraints, and the condition that vehicles must first complete all deliveries before initiating any pickups points to a backhaul requirement post linehaul satisfaction. There is no mention of open routes or vehicle distance limits, making other variants less suitable.

The capacity of the boats is also a factor, but it's noted that when other features are present, the "C" (capacity) is implicitly considered.

Description: Coastal lighthouse keepers need regular provisions of fuel, maintenance parts, and supplies. A maritime logistics team uses supply boats (<capacity> ton capacity) to service <num_customer> lighthouses along a rugged coastline. To prevent fuel shortages, each boat's route must not exceed <distance_limit> nautical miles. After delivering to the furthest lighthouse, crews remain on-site to assist with installation, ensuring no wasted return trips while balancing cargo loads precisely.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the supply boats have a capacity limit, and each boat's route must not exceed a certain distance. This directly implies the presence of both "C" (capacity) and "L" (distance limits) attributes. Since there is no mention of backhaul ("B"), mixed backhaul ("MB"), or time window constraints ("TW"), and it is clearly stated that after delivering to the furthest lighthouse, the crews remain on-site, suggesting an open route where vehicles do not return to the depot, this points us towards the "O" (open route) attribute. However, in the provided variants, "O" is typically combined with other attributes like "B", "L", "TW", etc., and since "L" (distance limit) is a key factor here and "O" is implied by the operational context, the most fitting variant is VRPL (Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits), as the list does not offer a direct OVRPL variant without additional attributes.

Description: A national postal service must deliver packages to residential customers and collect returned items for redistribution. Delivery trucks (with <capacity> kg capacity) start and end at a central depot <loc_depot>. Linehaul stops (deliveries) must occur before backhaul stops (pickups). Each customer has a time window <time_windows> for service (e.g., daytime availability), and drivers cannot exceed an 8-hour shift (<duration_limit>). The challenge is to minimize route distances while ensuring all deliveries are completed before pickups and adhering to strict shift constraints.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the delivery trucks have a specific capacity, linehaul stops (deliveries) must occur before backhaul stops (pickups), and each customer has a time window for service. Additionally, there is a duration limit for the drivers' shifts, which implies a type of constraint on the total route length or activity duration. However, since the focus is on the sequence of deliveries and pickups, and the presence of strict time windows, the most fitting variant is VRPBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and Time Windows. The "B" accounts for the backhaul after all linehaul, and "TW" addresses the time window constraints. The capacity and shift duration constraints are common in these problems but do not require a separate identifier here.

Description: A contractor coordinates trucks (capacity <capacity>) to deliver supplies (<demand_linehaul>) to construction sites (<loc_customer>) and haul away debris (<demand_backhaul>). Sites enforce time windows (<time_windows>) to avoid disrupting ongoing work. Trucks depart from a storage yard (<loc_depot>) and park near their final site for next-day use. The problem requires optimizing mixed-load routes to minimize idle time between deliveries and pickups while adhering to site access constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes trucks with a specific capacity, backhaul demand that needs to be satisfied (hauling away debris), and time window constraints for deliveries and pickups at the construction sites. Additionally, it mentions optimizing mixed-load routes, indicating that both linehaul and backhaul demands can be handled simultaneously. The scenario does not mention open routes or distance limits for the vehicles, thus excluding "O" and "L" from the variant. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows.

Description: A gallery network hosts rotating exhibitions requiring artwork delivery (linehaul) to venues (<loc_customer>) during installation windows (<time_windows>). After the exhibit concludes, empty crates and unused materials are collected (backhaul). Artwork dimensions (<demand>) and fragile handling constraints demand precise capacity planning (<capacity>). Curators enforce strict deadlines for setup and teardown. Drivers finish routes at the last venue, avoiding depot return trips.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key attributes: the need for precise capacity planning, backhaul operations after the exhibition, strict time windows for setup and teardown, and the fact that drivers finish their routes at the last venue, implying an open route. These features correspond to "C" (capacity), "B" (backhaul), "TW" (time window constraints), and "O" (open route) in the variant nomenclature. The most specific variant that encompasses all these aspects is OVRPBLTW.

Deliveries (linehaul) of excavators or cranes must precede pickups (backhaul) of equipment. Each site has a time window for equipment delivery (e.g., morning setup) and pickup (e.g., post-construction). Vehicles cannot exceed capacity limits for weight and volume, must stay within daily distance constraints, and finish routes at the final site. This ensures timely equipment availability while optimizing fuel use and route efficiency.

However, since the variant 'B' (backhaul) is specifically mentioned, and it includes the requirement that backhaul only occurs after linehaul, the capacity constraint 'C' is subsumed under this condition. The final aspect is that vehicles finish routes at the final site, which does not directly match an open route but fits more closely with the variants that include backhaul and time windows.

Description: A school district needs to deliver textbooks and lab equipment (linehaul) to schools (<loc_customer>) before the academic term begins (<time_windows>). At the end of the term, they collect used materials (backhaul) for redistribution or repair. Each school specifies time windows for delivery during setup weeks and pickup during closure periods. Vehicles (<capacity>) originate from the education supply depot (<loc_depot>), ensure deliveries precede pickups, and finish routes at the final collection point to avoid unnecessary returns. Efficiency is critical to support smooth academic transitions.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the school district needs to deliver (linehaul) and collect (backhaul) materials, with backhaul occurring only after all deliveries are made. Additionally, each school has specific time windows for delivery and pickup, and the vehicles must start from a depot and end at a final collection point, implying closed routes. The presence of both backhaul and time window constraints makes VRPBLTW the most fitting variant, as it encompasses backhauling that follows linehauling and time window restrictions.

Starting from a processing plant (<loc_depot>), routes must stay under <distance_limit> km due to odor containment requirements. The system optimizes simultaneous waste collection and fertilizer redistribution in a single trip.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the trucks have a capacity constraint, which would typically point to CVRP. However, since the problem also involves distance limits (L) and both linehaul (distributing fertilizer) and backhaul (collecting organic waste) demands being satisfied simultaneously (MB), the most specific variant that matches these criteria is VRPMBL. The presence of a processing plant as a starting point implies closed routes, so "O" variants are not applicable. Additionally, there are no explicit time window constraints mentioned, so "TW" is not included.

Description: A tech company provides temporary satellite internet hotspots (linehaul) to underserved rural areas during a seasonal event, such as a cultural festival. Each location requires setup within a specific time window to ensure connectivity during peak attendance. Post-event, equipment is collected (backhaul) for redistribution. Vehicles must prioritize delivery before pickup, staying within weight limits. Routes terminate at the last collection point, and time windows align with event schedules, with service times accounting for equipment configuration.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes that align with specific variants: 1) There is a backhaul (B) aspect as the equipment is collected post-event for redistribution. 2) The service involves linehaul (L) activities, delivering and setting up equipment, before backhauling, implying a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario. 3) Time window constraints (TW) are explicitly mentioned, as each location requires setup within a specific time window to ensure connectivity during peak attendance, and routes must align with event schedules. Given these details, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBTW, which accounts for mixed backhaul and time window constraints. Although there is a mention of weight limits, it does not specify distance limits, so "L" is not included in the variant selection.

Hotels have strict delivery/pickup windows (<time_windows>) for minimal operational disruption. Vans start at the processing plant (<loc_depot>) but may end routes at any location after final service. The mixed nature allows alternating deliveries and pickups based on real-time needs.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vans have a capacity limit, there are strict time windows for deliveries and pickups, and the routes can end at any location after the final service. The mixed nature of the operations allows for alternating deliveries and pickups, indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. These features match the 'OVRPMBTW' variant, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows.

After attendees finish using them, organizers must collect the devices (backhaul) without returning to the main office. Vehicles must ensure deliveries precede pickups, respect capacity constraints, and minimize downtime between session transitions.
Reason: The problem description specifies that laptops and accessories need to be delivered (linehaul) and then collected (backhaul) without returning to the main office, indicating an open route. Additionally, there are strict time windows for deliveries and pickups, which align with session starts, implying time window constraints. The requirement that deliveries precede pickups and the mention of capacity constraints also supports these features.

Crews must arrive within a time window (<time_windows>) to coordinate with technicians, and routes cannot exceed <distance_limit> km due to fuel and safety constraints. Vehicles terminate at their final destination after completing deliveries, ensuring efficient use of resources while respecting time and distance limits.
Reason: The problem description includes capacity constraints for the trucks, time windows for the arrival of the crews, and a distance limit for the routes. There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, nor does it indicate that the routes are open (vehicles do not return to the depot).

Strict time windows (<time_windows>) correspond to animal activity patterns. Vehicles (capacity <capacity> kg) have off-road range limits (<distance_limit> km) and remain at final sites for overnight camping.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: there are capacity limits for the vehicles, backhaul and linehaul demands (with the backhaul only being satisfied after all linehaul is done), distance limits for the vehicles, and strict time windows. The "O" attribute (open route) is not applicable as the vehicles remain at final sites for overnight camping, implying they do not return to the depot at the end of each day. Thus, considering these factors, the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, Time Windows, and Distance Limits.

Each unit starts at a depot (<loc_depot>) with a limited battery supply (<capacity> kWh) and visits EVs (<loc_customer>) needing either charging (<demand_linehaul>) or battery diagnostics (<demand_backhaul>). Service must occur within owners' availability windows (<time_windows>), and units can perform tasks in any order. After the final service, units park at their last location (no depot return). The goal is to maximize serviced EVs while minimizing travel distance and respecting battery capacity constraints.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the mobile charging units start at a depot, have a limited battery supply (capacity), and do not need to return to the depot after completing their tasks (open route). Additionally, it mentions that each unit can serve both charging (linehaul) and battery diagnostics (backhaul) demands, with these services being performed in any order. The service must occur within specific time windows, and there is a goal to minimize travel distance, indicating that the vehicles have some form of distance limitation. Given these details, the variant that best fits this scenario is OVRPMBLTW, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Limited Distance, and Time Windows.

Deployments must occur within critical 2-hour windows (<time_windows>) after crisis alerts, while pickups follow 24-hour post-deployment. Each vehicle (<capacity> gear units) has a 12-hour operational limit (<duration_limit>). The solution requires prioritizing urgent deliveries, ensuring return trips do not exceed time constraints, and managing fluctuating demand across disaster zones.
Reason: The problem description indicates the presence of both linehaul and backhaul demands, with a condition that backhaul (retrieving used equipment) follows after linehaul (deploying rescue kits), implying a backhaul demand can only be satisfied once all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there are strict time window constraints for deployments (within 2-hour windows) and pickups (24 hours post-deployment). There is also a capacity limit per vehicle, and an operational duration limit, but this does not directly translate to a distance limit as described in the variant definitions. The scenario does not suggest an open route, meaning vehicles do need to return to the depot. Given these conditions, the most specific variant that fits the described situation is VRPBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows.

Specialized vehicles (<capacity>) have a <distance_limit>-km range due to battery and contamination-control protocols. Routes must dynamically sequence deliveries and pickups while avoiding cross-contamination risks.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: there are specific demands for both linehaul (transporting semiconductor wafers) and backhaul (collecting defective units), with the condition that backhaul can only be satisfied after linehaul, indicating a 'B' (backhaul) characteristic. Additionally, the vehicles have a distance limit due to battery and contamination-control protocols, which aligns with the 'L' (distance limits) feature.

Reason: The problem involves linehaul (attaching new GPS collars) and backhaul (recovering old units) operations, with a condition that backhaul demand can only be satisfied after the linehaul demand is met. Additionally, there are distance limits due to fuel constraints, and the routes are open since the teams do not return to the depot but camp at their final work site.

Description: A healthcare startup uses drones to transport temperature-sensitive medical samples (<demand>) from hospitals (<loc_customer>) to a central lab (<loc_depot>). Each drone has a limited payload (<capacity> kg) and battery range (<distance_limit> km). Samples must arrive at the lab within strict time windows (<time_windows>) to ensure diagnostic accuracy. Routes must optimize flight paths to avoid delays while respecting energy constraints.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key constraints: limited payload (capacity), battery range (distance limit), and strict time windows for sample delivery. There is no mention of backhaul or open routes, so the most specific variant that fits this scenario includes capacity, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: After a major earthquake, a telecom company must deploy temporary communication hubs to disaster-stricken areas. Equipment is stored at a central depot (<loc_depot>), and affected sites are at <loc_customer> locations. Each delivery vehicle can carry up to <capacity> kg of equipment and must return to the depot within <distance_limit> km to ensure continuous supply availability. Each site requires a specific amount of equipment. Plan routes to deliver all equipment without exceeding capacity or distance constraints, minimizing total travel distance.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each delivery vehicle has a capacity limit and a distance limit, and it also specifies that the vehicles must return to the depot. There are no backhaul demands or time windows mentioned, making CVRPL (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits) the most appropriate variant. The "C" in CVRPL stands for capacity, which is a key constraint in this scenario, and "L" represents the distance limits, fitting the requirement of not exceeding <distance_limit> km.

Description: A security firm must transport barricades, surveillance cameras, and access control systems to stadiums hosting international tournaments. Each venue (<loc_customer>) demands equipment delivery within a narrow time frame (<time_windows>) ahead of kickoff. Trucks (<capacity>) carry limited cargo and must complete routes within <distance_limit> to avoid overtime costs. After unloading at the final stadium, drivers end their shifts there, ensuring no unnecessary return trips.
Reason: The problem description includes specific time windows for deliveries, a distance limit for the routes to avoid overtime costs, and the condition that drivers end their shifts at the final stadium, implying an open route. These features align with the "OVRPTW" (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows) and "OVRPL" (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits) variants. However, since time window constraints are more specifically mentioned and are a key requirement, "OVRPTW" is the most fitting variant.

Description: Following a wildfire, relief teams must deliver tents, medical kits, and food to temporary shelters (<loc_customer>) established in evacuation zones. Each shelter has a strict deadline (e.g., “supplies must arrive within 6 hours of activation”) to accommodate displaced residents. Vehicles depart from a disaster response hub (<loc_depot>), each with a <capacity> kg limit. Routes must respect time windows dictated by shelter activation times, and trucks are permitted to conclude operations at the final delivery point to assist with immediate distribution efforts.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each vehicle has a capacity limit, and there are strict time windows for delivering supplies to the shelters. The routes must respect these time windows based on shelter activation times. There is no mention of backhaul, distance limits for the vehicles, or the requirement for the vehicles to return to the depot after their final delivery. Thus, the most fitting variant is VRPTW, which includes time window constraints.

Description: A production company delivers stage structures, lighting rigs, and audio systems to concert venues. Each venue (<loc_customer>) imposes strict setup time windows (<time_window>) before public access begins. Delivery trucks (capacity: <capacity> tons) start from the staging warehouse (<loc_depot>), load equipment within load limits, and proceed to destinations. Routes conclude at the final unloading point. The objective is to complete deliveries within venue schedules while avoiding overloading any vehicle, ensuring shows start on time.
Reason: The problem description includes specific time windows for setup at each venue, which directly corresponds to the "TW" (time window constraints) attribute. The capacity of the trucks is also a key consideration, indicated by the need to avoid overloading any vehicle. However, since the presence of "TW" overrides the necessity to specify "C" (capacity), and there are no indications of backhaul ("B"), mixed backhaul ("MB"), open routes ("O"), or distance limits ("L") in the given scenario, the most fitting variant is VRPTW.

Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile units to administer COVID-19 tests and vaccines across urban and rural communities. Each unit starts at a central depot (<loc_depot>) with limited cold storage capacity (<capacity>). Testing sites (<loc_customer>) have specific time windows (<time_windows>) for service due to staffing constraints, while vaccines must be delivered before expiration. Units can perform tests (pickups) and deliver vaccines (drop-offs) in any order but must complete routes within <distance_limit> km due to refrigeration limits. After the final stop, units park at local clinics instead of returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: limited cold storage capacity, specific time windows for service, a distance limit for each route, and the fact that units do not return to the depot but park at local clinics. These map directly to the following features in the VRP variants: Capacity (C), Time Windows (TW), Distance Limits (L), and Open Routes (O). Since the problem involves both pickups (tests) and deliveries (vaccines) without a strict order, it aligns with a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario. However, the presence of O, L, and TW makes these the most critical identifiers. The "MB" is implied by the nature of tasks (pickups and drop-offs) and does not change the selection among the given options. Thus, the variant that best fits this description is OVRPLTW, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Load and Time Window constraints.

Description: Researchers deploy monitoring buoys from a coastal base (<loc_depot>) to marine sites (<loc_customer>). Boats have limited cargo capacity (<capacity>) and fuel range (<distance_limit>). Some stops require deploying equipment (linehaul) while others retrieve damaged units (backhaul), with order flexible based on tidal conditions. Each site has narrow accessible time windows (<time_windows>) dictated by tides, and installations require precise durations (<service_time>). The objective is to complete all deployments/recoveries within tidal cycles while minimizing nautical miles traveled.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple critical features: boats have limited cargo capacity (C), a distance limit (L), and some stops require deploying equipment (linehaul) while others retrieve damaged units (backhaul with MB, since it does not specify that backhaul can only occur after linehaul). Additionally, each site has narrow accessible time windows (TW) dictated by tides. Given these elements, the variant VRPMBLTW is the most fitting as it encompasses all the specified requirements.

Description: A tech company services edge data centers (<loc_customer>) by delivering charged coolant tanks (linehaul) and retrieving depleted ones (backhaul). Vehicles with <capacity> tank capacity must operate within <time_windows> to avoid server overheating. Each route is capped at <distance_limit> km due to coolant temperature maintenance requirements. Technicians start at the refrigeration plant (<loc_depot>) but may end routes at designated parking zones near high-priority sites.
Reason: The problem description specifies that vehicles have a tank capacity, there are distance limits due to coolant temperature maintenance, and time windows must be adhered to avoid server overheating. Additionally, the routes are open, as vehicles do not necessarily return to the depot but can end at designated parking zones. The backhaul (retrieving depleted tanks) can only happen after the linehaul (delivering charged tanks) demand is satisfied, which aligns with the "B" characteristic. However, since the "B" characteristic already implies the presence of capacity, we do not need to explicitly include "C". Therefore, the most fitting variant includes Open Route (O), Backhaul (B), Distance Limits (L), and Time Windows (TW).

Description: A biotechnology firm must deliver temperature-sensitive biopharmaceuticals to clinical trial sites (<loc_customer>) across the country. Each site has a critical time window (<time_windows>) to receive the shipment to maintain drug efficacy. The central lab (<loc_depot>) uses refrigerated trucks with a maximum payload capacity of <capacity> liters. Routes must ensure all sites are serviced within their windows while respecting vehicle capacities. Drivers end their routes at the final delivery point to conserve fuel and maximize trial timelines.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the biopharmaceuticals must be delivered within a critical time window to each clinical trial site, which aligns with the "TW" (time window) feature. Additionally, there is a maximum payload capacity for the refrigerated trucks, indicating the presence of a "C" (capacity) constraint. However, since the "TW" feature takes precedence over "C" in the classification, and no other features such as backhaul ("B"), open route ("O"), or distance limits ("L") are mentioned, the most appropriate variant is VRPTW.

Description: During a natural disaster, your NGO must deliver emergency kits, tarps, and blankets (<demand> kg) to evacuation centers (<loc_customer>) from your regional hub (<loc_depot>). Your trucks have a maximum load of <capacity> kg. You must:  
✓ Design routes that prevent overloading any vehicle.  
✓ Prioritize delivery efficiency to maximize coverage.  
✓ Allow drivers to remain at the final drop-off to assist with unloading.  
This ensures critical supplies reach affected areas quickly while minimizing logistical waste.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks have a maximum load capacity, which aligns with the 'C' (capacity) constraint. There is no mention of backhaul demand ('B'), distance limits for vehicles ('L'), open routes where vehicles do not return to the depot ('O'), or time window constraints for deliveries ('TW'). Therefore, the most specific variant that fits this scenario is CVRP, which focuses on capacity constraints.

Description: A farm supplies business delivers seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers (linehaul) and retrieves empty pesticide containers for recycling (backhaul). Deliveries must occur before pickups to maintain safety standards and prevent contamination. Vehicles, constrained by their capacity, finalize their routes at the last container collection site, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations while optimizing travel efficiency.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the business delivers goods (linehaul) and retrieves empty containers (backhaul), with the condition that all deliveries must occur before pickups. This aligns with the "B" variant, indicating backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand. Additionally, there is a mention of vehicles being constrained by their capacity, which is represented by "C". However, since the "B" feature takes precedence over "C" in the provided list, we prioritize it. There are no explicit mentions of distance limits ("L"), open routes ("O"), mixed backhaul operations ("MB"), or time window constraints ("TW") in the given scenario, so these features are not included in the classification.

Description: A government agency is upgrading communication towers in rugged mountainous regions. Each tower site at <loc_customer> needs specific equipment (antennas, power generators, satellite dishes) with different weights. Delivery trucks from the central hub at <loc_depot> have a maximum capacity of <capacity> kg. The narrow, winding mountain roads impose strict weight limits to prevent road damage. Planners must design routes to deliver all items precisely, ensuring no truck exceeds its capacity while minimizing total driving distance and reaching even the most remote sites.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks have a maximum capacity (C), and there are strict weight limits on the narrow, winding mountain roads, which can be interpreted as distance or route constraints (L). Additionally, the need to minimize total driving distance while reaching even the most remote sites suggests optimizing routes with these limitations in mind. There is no mention of backhaul demands (B), mixed backhaul (MB), or time window constraints (TW), and it is implied that the vehicles do return to the depot, so the open route (O) variant does not apply. Given these conditions, the most specific and appropriate variant from the provided list is VRPL, indicating a Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits.

Vans (capacity <capacity>) follow mixed sequences and park at final locations for decontamination.
Reason: The problem description includes several key elements: capacity constraints for the vans, linehaul demand (administering tests), backhaul demand (collecting biohazard waste) that can be satisfied simultaneously with linehaul demand, and time windows for service. The scenario also mentions mixed sequences but does not explicitly require open routes or distance limits for the vehicles. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these criteria is VRPMBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows.

Description: A health agency deploys mobile clinics (capacity: `<capacity>`) from a hub (`<loc_depot>`) to administer vaccines (`<demand_linehaul>`) and collect used syringes (`<demand_backhaul>`) at `<num_customer>` neighborhoods (`<loc_customer>`). Challenges:  
- **Time windows** (`<time_windows>`): Clinics operate only during community-approved hours.  
- **Distance limits** (`<distance_limit>`): Clinics must return to the hub before vaccine coolers lose potency.  
- **Mixed sequencing**: A clinic might vaccinate at Stop 1, collect waste at Stop 2, then vaccinate at Stop 3.  
*Goal*: Maximize vaccinations/day while complying with safety constraints.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the mobile clinics have a capacity limit, operate within time windows, and have distance limits. Additionally, the mixed sequencing requirement indicates that both linehaul (vaccinations) and backhaul (collecting used syringes) demands can be satisfied simultaneously. This matches with the VRPMBLTW variant, which includes Mixed Backhaul (MB), Linehaul (L), and Time Windows (TW). The open route (O) is not applicable as the clinics must return to the hub, thus this variant is not considered.

Each truck can travel a maximum of <distance_limit> km round-trip. Design routes ensuring all batteries reach their destinations without exceeding vehicle capacity or distance limits.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each truck has a capacity limit for the batteries, and there is a distance limit for how far the trucks can travel round-trip before needing to return to the depot.

Routes are constrained to <distance_limit> km to avoid logistical delays, and vehicles end at the final site post-collection to streamline post-event cleanup.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the trucks have a capacity limit, there is both linehaul (delivering equipment) and backhaul (retrieving used materials) demand, and the vehicles have distance limits.

Each station has a time window for receipt (to align with researcher availability), and kits vary in quantity (demand). Delivery vehicles from the central lab (depot) must stay within distance limits to avoid fuel shortages, ending routes at the furthest station without returning. Capacity constraints on vehicles ensure proper kit allocation while adhering to strict operational timelines.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: the vehicles have distance limits (L), there are strict time windows for delivery to align with researcher availability (TW), and the routes are open, meaning the vehicles do not return to the depot but end at the furthest station (O). There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands. Given these specifics, the most fitting variant from the list is OVRPTW, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows.

Routes finish at the final teardown location, reducing idle time and ensuring rapid equipment redistribution for subsequent events.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: capacity constraints, strict time windows for setup and teardown, and the requirement that trucks prioritize deliveries before pickups. The presence of time windows (TW) is a critical factor, as each venue has specific time frames for setup and teardown. Additionally, the need to prioritize deliveries before pickups aligns with the backhaul (B) characteristic, where backhaul (pickup) demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul (delivery) demand is met. The open route (O) feature is not applicable here since the routes finish at the final teardown location, indicating a return to a depot or a defined endpoint.

The requirement to service all stations and minimize total distance while ensuring no vehicle is overloaded points towards a scenario with capacity constraints. Since the backhaul demand (depleted batteries for recycling) can only be satisfied after fulfilling the linehaul demand (fresh batteries), and there is a distance limit on the routes, the most fitting variant is VRPBL.

Reason: The problem description includes a central hub (depot) from which the mobile charging units start and end their routes, indicating that the routes are not open. It mentions that each unit has a capacity limit for charging EVs, and there is a need to collect depleted batteries (backhaul). Additionally, the vehicles have distance limits due to shift constraints, and the goal involves optimizing both the number of serviced EVs and the total fleet mileage, but no specific time windows are mentioned for service.

Reason: The problem description mentions that vans have a maximum range of <distance_limit> km per trip, which corresponds to the "L" (distance limit) attribute. Additionally, it specifies that routes must alternate between drop-offs and pickups, indicating that both linehaul and backhaul demands are being satisfied simultaneously, which fits the "MB" (mixed backhaul) feature. There is no indication of time windows or open routes, so "TW" and "O" do not apply. The "C" (capacity) constraint is present but is less specific than the "L" and "MB" attributes in this context.

Description: A drone rental service delivers survey drones to construction sites for topographic mapping and retrieves them afterward. Each site has a delivery window before survey operations begin and a pickup window after completion. Delivery trucks must first transport drones (linehaul) to all locations, then return to collect them (backhaul). Capacity limits restrict the number of drones per truck, and routes are constrained by distance to cover regional projects efficiently. All deliveries must arrive before survey starts, and pickups must occur after project deadlines.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks must first transport drones (linehaul) to all locations, and then return to collect them (backhaul). This indicates a backhaul requirement. Additionally, there are specific time windows for both deliveries and pickups, meaning the service must be provided within defined time frames. The presence of distance constraints on routes is also mentioned, which adds another layer of complexity. Since the scenario does not suggest that the vehicles do not have to return to the depot (which would indicate an "O" or open route), and considering all the given constraints, the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW.

Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 72
Description: A storage service provider delivers portable containers to residential and commercial customers (<loc_customer>) needing short-term storage (linehaul) and later collects empty containers for redistribution (backhaul). Each truck must first deliver containers (<demand_linehaul>) to new clients without exceeding its weight and space limits (<capacity>). After completing all deliveries, the truck proceeds to retrieve empty containers (<demand_backhaul>) from clients who no longer need them, concluding its route at the last pickup location. The goal is to plan routes that minimize travel distance while ensuring deliveries always precede pickups, preventing capacity overloads.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the truck must deliver containers (linehaul) to new clients before picking up empty containers (backhaul), and there are capacity limits for the trucks. This matches the VRP with backhaul (VRPB) characteristics, as it ensures deliveries always precede pickups and considers the capacity constraints. There is no mention of distance limits, time windows, or the need for open routes, so more specific variants including "L", "TW", or "O" are not applicable.

Description: A healthcare organization sends mobile clinics to remote areas (<loc_customer>) for health screenings. Vehicles depart from the central hub (<loc_depot>), first deploying medical equipment (linehaul) to service locations. After completing their missions, they collect used supplies and equipment (backhaul) for restocking. The vehicle capacity (<capacity>) must balance deployed gear and returned materials. Routes terminate at the last clinic location, prioritizing delivery before pickup and reducing travel overhead.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles must first deliver medical equipment (linehaul) and then collect used supplies and equipment (backhaul), with the backhaul only occurring after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, the vehicle capacity must balance both deployed gear and returned materials, indicating a need for managing capacities for both types of cargo. Since there is no mention of open routes, distance limits, or time windows, but there is a clear distinction between linehaul and backhaul with a priority for linehaul, the VRPB variant best fits this scenario.

Description: A civil engineering firm must deploy teams to install floodgates in vulnerable areas before predicted storm surges (<time_windows>). Each site requires specific materials (<demand>), and vehicles (<capacity> ton capacity) must start from a central depot (<loc_depot>). Due to limited fuel and road accessibility, routes must not exceed <distance_limit> km. Teams must arrive at each location within critical timeframes to prevent catastrophic flooding.
Reason: The problem description mentions specific capacities for the vehicles, distance limits due to limited fuel and road accessibility, and time windows as teams must arrive at each location within critical timeframes. There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, nor any indication that the routes are open (i.e., not returning to the depot). Therefore, the variant that includes capacity, distance limit, and time window constraints is the most fitting.

Description: Mobile medical units deliver critical supplies (linehaul) to remote clinics and collect blood samples (backhaul) for lab analysis. Each clinic (<loc_customer>) has time windows (<time_windows>) based on staff availability. Vehicles (<capacity>) face <distance_limit> km limits due to rugged terrain. Deliveries must occur before pickups to ensure sample storage. Routes can end at the last clinic or depot after pickups, ensuring supplies are delivered and samples returned efficiently within capacity constraints.
Reason: The problem description indicates that vehicles have distance limits (L), there are time window constraints (TW) for service at clinics, and the operation involves both linehaul (deliveries of supplies) and backhaul (collection of blood samples) with the requirement that deliveries must occur before pickups. This points towards a variant that includes mixed backhaul (MB) operations, as both types of demand can be satisfied simultaneously under the given conditions. The open route (O) is not specifically mentioned, so it is not included in the selection. Given these elements, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBLTW.

Description: Agricultural tech providers supply soil sensors and irrigation controllers (<demand_linehaul>) to farms (<loc_customer>) while collecting data loggers from previous deployments (<demand_backhaul>). Sensors and loggers must be transported together without exceeding <capacity> kg. Each route originates from the tech hub (<loc_depot>), prioritizes delivery before pickup, and stays within <distance_limit> km to ensure timely data collection. Vehicles conclude at the last farm to avoid extra mileage.
Reason: The problem description includes the need for transporting both soil sensors and irrigation controllers (linehaul) as well as collecting data loggers (backhaul), with a priority on delivery before pickup. This indicates a mixed backhaul scenario (MB). Additionally, there is a capacity constraint (<capacity> kg) and a distance limit per route (<distance_limit> km). The routes do not return to the depot but end at the last farm, indicating an open route (O). No specific time window constraints are mentioned, so TW is not included.

Description: A lubricant distributor supplies fresh hydraulic oil to manufacturing facilities (<loc_customer>) while retrieving used oil drums for recycling. Each truck starts at the depot (<loc_depot>) with a <capacity> liter capacity, first delivering new oil (linehaul), then collecting used drums (backhaul). The route ensures deliveries precede pickups to prevent mixing, and the truck ends its journey at the final drop-off point.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each truck has a capacity limit, which is indicated by the "C" in CVRP. Additionally, it mentions that the route ensures deliveries (linehaul) precede pickups (backhaul), and both operations are performed by the same vehicle. This scenario matches the "B" (backhaul) characteristic, as backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands. There is no mention of open routes, distance limits, or time window constraints, so these features ("O", "L", "TW") are not applicable. The most fitting variant, therefore, is VRPB.

Description: A food truck network requires fresh cooking equipment and supplies (linehaul) to be delivered to bustling city locations, while simultaneously collecting used cooking oil and waste materials (backhaul). Each delivery truck can carry up to <capacity> kg, and routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius of the central kitchen to ensure timely returns. The solution must balance load distribution and route efficiency to minimize fuel costs and environmental impact.
Reason: The problem description mentions both linehaul (delivering fresh cooking equipment and supplies) and backhaul (collecting used cooking oil and waste materials) operations, which suggests a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, there is a specific mention of a distance limit for the routes to ensure timely returns, indicating that the vehicles have a maximum travel distance. No open route or time window constraints are specified, so these attributes are not considered. The capacity of the trucks is also a factor, but since we already have "MB" and "L", we do not add "C".

Description: A telecommunications firm is expanding internet access to remote villages. Engineers must deploy satellite dishes (<demand> units per village) to <num_customer> rural locations (<loc_customer>). Delivery trucks from the central hub (<loc_depot>) can carry a maximum of <capacity> dishes. To avoid overextension, each truck’s route must not exceed <distance_limit> km. Once all dishes are installed, the trucks finish their work at the last village, reducing logistical overhead.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks have a capacity limit for carrying satellite dishes, and each truck’s route must not exceed a certain distance. There is no mention of backhaul demand, time windows, or the requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, which aligns with the "CVRP" (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem) variant. The open route characteristic is implied by the statement that trucks finish their work at the last village, but the primary constraints are capacity and distance, making CVRP the most fitting classification.

Description: A construction equipment rental company dispatches bulldozers, excavators, and other machinery to job sites and later retrieves them once projects are completed. The trucks must deliver machinery to customers first before returning to collect equipment, as idle machinery on trucks reduces space for new deliveries. Each vehicle’s capacity (<capacity>) must handle the weight of both outgoing rentals (<demand_linehaul>) and returning equipment (<demand_backhaul>). The depot’s locations and 20 customer sites (<locs>) vary daily, requiring dynamic route planning to minimize idle time and maximize equipment turnover.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles have a capacity constraint, there is a backhaul demand (returning equipment) that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand (delivering machinery) is met, and there are dynamic locations for depots and customer sites which imply time window constraints to manage the varying schedules. However, it does not mention any open routes or distance limits. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW, as it includes capacity (C), backhaul (B), and time window (TW) constraints.

Vans (<capacity>) start at a central warehouse (<loc_depot>) and follow flexible routes where deliveries and pickups are sequenced dynamically (e.g., swapping lenses at one site before delivering tripods to another). Vehicles stay at the last shoot location for crew convenience.
Reason: The problem involves both delivering (linehaul) and collecting (backhaul) items, with the backhaul only happening after all deliveries are made. This matches the "B" (backhaul) feature. The description also mentions that vehicles start at a central warehouse and end at the last shoot location, which implies an open route, matching the "O" (open) feature. There is no explicit mention of distance limits or time window constraints, so "L" and "TW" are not applicable. Given these conditions, the most appropriate variant is OVRPB.

Specialized wildlife transport vehicles (<capacity>) start from the rescue center (<loc_depot>), carrying only permitted payloads of animals or equipment. Routes finalize at the last stop to minimize stress on the animals during transit.
Reason: The problem description specifies that there are specialized wildlife transport vehicles with capacity constraints, and the relocations must occur within specific time windows that align with environmental conditions. There is no mention of open routes, backhaul demands, or distance limits for the vehicles. Thus, the most appropriate variant from the list, considering the presence of capacity and time window constraints, is VRPTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows).

Description: A concert organizer must deliver stage equipment to multiple venues (linehaul) before showtimes, then collect the equipment (backhaul) after events conclude. Each venue has strict time windows for setup completion and pickup. Vehicles must carry both delivered and collected equipment without exceeding capacity. The goal is to minimize total distance while adhering to time constraints and ensuring all equipment is returned efficiently.
Reason: The problem description includes both linehaul (delivering stage equipment) and backhaul (collecting the equipment after the event) operations, which indicates a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, there are strict time windows for setup completion and pickup, and vehicles must adhere to capacity limits. These characteristics best match the VRPMBTW variant, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows.

Trucks (capacity <capacity>) depart from a central yard (<loc_depot>) with strict <distance_limit> constraints to ensure same-day returns. Setup/teardown time windows (<time_windows>) vary by venue. Crews end routes at the last venue to assist with equipment installation.
Reason: The problem description includes the need for trucks to deliver generators (linehaul demand) and collect depleted fuel tanks (backhaul demand), with the condition that backhaul can only be satisfied after all linehaul is completed. There are also strict distance limits for the trucks, and specific time windows for setup/teardown at venues. The open route characteristic does not apply as it's mentioned that trucks depart from and must return to a central yard on the same day. These conditions match the VRPBLTW variant, which accounts for backhaul (B) that can only occur after linehaul, distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).

With vessel capacity <capacity> and maximum operational range <distance_limit> nautical miles, routes must strategically sequence deliveries and collections based on real-time boat locations and catch volumes, prioritizing perishable goods.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the support vessel has a capacity limit, must deliver supplies (linehaul) and collect catches (backhaul), with the backhaul only occurring after linehaul demands are met. Additionally, the vessel has a maximum operational range, which implies a distance limit. There is no mention of open routes or time windows, so these features are not included in the variant selection.

Description: A food truck operator hosts seasonal street festivals, requiring temporary kitchens, grills, and utensils to be delivered (linehaul) to event locations before setup deadlines (TW). After the festival, all equipment must be retrieved (backhaul) by a specified time to avoid storage fees. Vehicles have limited capacity for transporting bulky items, and routes must account for festival-specific time windows, traffic patterns, and the need to service multiple events simultaneously.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key attributes that align with specific variants. Firstly, there are capacity constraints on the vehicles, which is a common feature but not specifically denoted when other features like backhaul or time windows are present. The requirement for transporting equipment to and from events indicates a need for both linehaul (delivery) and backhaul (pickup) operations, fitting the 'MB' (mixed backhaul) characteristic. Moreover, the presence of setup deadlines and retrieval times for avoiding storage fees points directly towards 'TW' (time window) constraints. Lastly, the scenario does not explicitly state that vehicles must return to a depot, nor does it emphasize vehicle distance limits, thus not clearly fitting 'O' (open route) or 'L' (distance limit). Given these considerations, the most suitable variant is VRPMBTW.

Description: A film production company uses trucks to deliver camera gear, lighting equipment, and set materials to various filming locations and later collect the same items after shoots. Each truck has a maximum capacity :math:`Q`, restricting the total weight of deliveries and pickups on the route. The order of deliveries and pickups can be sequenced in any order along the route. The central warehouse and 20 filming locations are at <locs>. Delivery demands for equipment are <demand_linehaul>, and pickup demands for returned gear are <demand_backhaul>. The challenge is to design routes that minimize travel costs while ensuring all equipment is delivered and retrieved without exceeding truck capacities.
Reason: The problem specifies that the trucks have a maximum capacity (Q), and there are both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) demands. It is also mentioned that backhaul can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, which aligns with the "B" (backhaul) characteristic. There is no mention of distance limits, open routes, or time windows, so we do not include "L", "O", or "TW". The base problem is a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with Capacity constraints, but since "C" is ignored when other features like "B" are present, the most specific variant is VRPB.

Description: A tool rental service supplies construction sites with heavy machinery, power tools, and safety equipment (linehaul) for short-term projects. After use, the tools are retrieved (backhaul) for redistribution. Each site has time windows based on crew availability and shift schedules. Vehicles must first deliver all equipment, then backtrack to collect items, ensuring their capacity (<capacity>) isn’t exceeded. The routes must conclude at the final pickup point to minimize idle driving time and fuel costs.
Reason: The problem description mentions that vehicles must first deliver all equipment (linehaul) and then backtrack to collect items (backhaul), which indicates a backhaul demand that can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is met. Additionally, the presence of time windows based on crew availability and shift schedules points to time window constraints. The capacity of the vehicles is also mentioned, but since we have more specific attributes like backhaul and time windows, the "C" for capacity is not the primary focus in the variant selection. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows.

Each morning, trucks (capacity: `<capacity>`) depart from a central warehouse (`<loc_depot>`) to redistribute scooters from low-demand areas (`<loc_customer>`, pickup demand: `<demand_backhaul>`) to high-demand zones (delivery demand: `<demand_linehaul>`). Routes are optimized to balance scooter availability without exceeding vehicle capacity, and drivers end their shifts at the last stop. Mixed sequencing allows prioritizing either pickups or deliveries based on real-time demand.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles have a capacity constraint, which is common across all variants. However, it specifically mentions the need to balance scooter availability by redistributing from low-demand areas to high-demand zones, indicating a mixed backhaul scenario (MB). The sequence of pickups and deliveries can be prioritized based on real-time demand, suggesting flexibility in handling both types of demands simultaneously. There is no explicit mention of distance limits (L), time window constraints (TW), or the requirement for vehicles to not return to the depot (O). Therefore, the most appropriate variant that fits this description is VRPMB, which allows for mixed backhaul without the additional constraints of distance, time windows, or open routes.

Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km range to avoid long detours, and drivers conclude their routes at the final customer address. The company seeks cost-effective delivery paths that maximize recycling pickup without overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks have a capacity limit (C), a distance limit (L) for their routes, and involves both delivering new items (linehaul) and collecting old items (backhaul) simultaneously (MB). There is no mention of time window constraints (TW) or that the vehicles do not return to the depot (O).

Description: Farmers rely on drones for crop monitoring, requiring fresh batteries to be delivered to field stations (linehaul) during daylight hours (time windows). Depleted batteries are collected afterward (backhaul) for recharging. Delivery trucks (capacity <capacity>) must first supply remote stations before backtracking to gather spent batteries, as drones cannot operate without charged replacements. Routes conclude at a regional charging hub, not the central depot, to streamline overnight processing. The goal is to optimize routes so drones operate continuously while adhering to strict battery-swapping deadlines and vehicle weight limits.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features: the need for fresh batteries to be delivered (linehaul) and depleted batteries to be collected (backhaul), with backhaul only occurring after all linehaul demands are met. There are also strict time window constraints for these operations, and the routes end at a regional charging hub rather than returning to the central depot, indicating an open route. Given these details, the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, and Time Windows, but since the routes do not return to the starting depot, the "O" prefix for Open routes is necessary, making it OVRPBLTW.

Description: A courier service transports sensitive documents to clients (<loc_customer>) and retrieves signed or processed copies for return. Deliveries must occur before pickups to ensure clients receive the documents first. Vehicles have a limited capacity (<capacity>) to hold both outgoing and incoming documents securely. Each client has a time window (<time_windows>): deliveries must be made by a specified deadline (e.g., 10 AM), while pickups are scheduled after the client’s processing time (e.g., 2 PM). The challenge is to route vehicles efficiently, respect strict time windows, and maintain document security without exceeding vehicle capacity.
Reason: The problem description specifies that vehicles have a limited capacity, deliveries and pickups must occur within specific time windows, and there is a need to manage both outgoing (linehaul) and incoming (backhaul) documents. The requirement for managing both types of demands simultaneously points towards a mixed backhaul scenario, and the strict time window constraints for both delivery and pickup are also highlighted. Since there is no mention of open routes or distance limits, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBTW, which accounts for mixed backhaul and time window constraints.

Narrow operating windows (<time_windows>) avoid peak boat traffic. Routes are constrained by battery life (<distance_limit> km), with boats docking at maintenance hubs after final stops.
Reason: The problem description includes boats with a capacity limit, both linehaul (emptying trash bins) and backhaul (retrieving floating debris) demands that can be satisfied simultaneously, distance limits due to battery life, and time windows to avoid peak boat traffic. The requirement for the boats to return to a maintenance hub after their final stops indicates a closed route.

Vehicles starting at <loc_depot> must first complete all deliveries before initiating pickups to prevent contamination risks. Each truck has a <capacity> constraint for both supplies and waste. Routes are restricted to <distance_limit> kilometers to ensure drivers can complete tasks without exceeding fuel or time limits, ending their shifts at the last shelter served.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: the need for vehicles to complete all deliveries (linehaul) before initiating pickups (backhaul), indicating a "B" for backhaul after linehaul. It also specifies that each truck has a capacity constraint for both supplies and waste, but this is covered under "B". The route restriction to a certain distance limit points to an "L" for limited vehicle distance. There is no mention of the routes being open, meaning the vehicles must return to the depot or end their shift at the last shelter, which excludes "O".

Routes must prioritize timely deliveries while ensuring capacity <capacity> isn’t exceeded. The depot and 20 customer locations are <locs>, with delivery demands <demand_linehaul> and pickup demands <demand_backhaul>.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the trucks must deliver materials (linehaul) and then collect used signage (backhaul) for reuse, which implies a backhaul demand. It also specifies that routes must prioritize timely deliveries, indicating time window constraints. The capacity constraint is also mentioned, but since we have more specific features like backhaul and time windows, the "C" (capacity) prefix is not needed in the variant name. There is no indication of open routes or vehicle distance limits, so "O" and "L" are not applicable. Given these details, the most appropriate variant is VRPBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows.

Description: A craft brewery supplies kegs to local bars and restaurants (<num_customer> locations), then collects empties for sanitization. Delivery trucks (<capacity> kg capacity) must first distribute filled kegs (<demand_linehaul>) during the day, adhering to each venue’s operational hours (<time_windows>). After deliveries, they proceed to collect empty kegs (<demand_backhaul>), ensuring the total weight of returned kegs doesn’t exceed truck capacity. The brewery requires pickups to occur within evening time windows to align with venue closures. The objective is to minimize route distances while respecting keg weight limits and avoiding late deliveries or pickups.
Reason: The problem description includes specific constraints such as time windows for both deliveries and pickups, backhaul (collecting empty kegs after all linehaul - delivering filled kegs - is completed), and capacity limits for the trucks. The presence of these features (time windows, backhaul, and capacity) aligns with the VRPBLTW variant. This variant specifically caters to situations where there are time window constraints (TW), backhaul demands that can only be satisfied after linehaul demands (B), and capacity constraints (C).

Description: A company must deliver new turbine components to offshore wind farms (linehaul) while collecting outdated equipment for recycling (backhaul). The transport vessels have a maximum capacity of <capacity> tons, requiring careful load balancing. Routes must ensure vessels return to the coastal depot within a <distance_limit> nautical mile limit to avoid refueling en route. The goal is to minimize total travel distance while safely handling both deliveries and pickups, adhering to strict environmental regulations.
Reason: The problem description mentions both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) operations, indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, there is a mention of a distance limit for the routes, which corresponds to the "L" attribute. The capacity constraint is also mentioned but is not as distinguishing since it is common in many VRP variants. There are no indications of open routes or time windows, so the most fitting variant is VRPMBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Distance Limits.

Description: A mobile veterinary service visits neighborhoods to administer pet vaccinations (linehaul) and collect blood samples for lab testing (backhaul). Each clinic van (<capacity> for supplies/samples) must serve appointments within strict time windows (<time_windows>) to align with pet owners’ availability. Routes are constrained by a maximum daily operating duration (<time_limit> hours) to ensure staff welfare. The mixed backhaul requirement allows sample pickups to occur before or after deliveries.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key aspects: capacity for supplies/samples, strict time windows for appointments, and a mixed backhaul requirement (collecting blood samples can occur before or after administering vaccinations). There is no mention of open routes or distance limits. Given these details, the most fitting variant is VRPMBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows.

Description: Marine archaeologists require specialized equipment (diving gear, sonar arrays) to be delivered to underwater excavation sites and must later retrieve recovered artifacts. Submersible support vessels (<capacity> m³) have a strict distance limit (<distance_limit>) due to limited battery life. Deliveries must occur first, followed by artifact pickups, with time windows (<time_window>) dictated by safe diving conditions during low tide. Expeditions must conclude before tidal shifts complicate retrieval operations.
Reason: The problem specifies a strict distance limit for the submersible support vessels, indicating a "L" (distance limit) attribute. Additionally, there are specific time windows for deliveries and pickups due to safe diving conditions, which corresponds to the "TW" (time window constraints) attribute. Since both "L" and "TW" are present, and there is no indication of an open route or backhaul requirements, the most appropriate variant that includes these features is VRPLTW.

Description: A research group prepares to explore Arctic ice shelves and requires equipment delivery to remote icebreaker stations. Each icebreaker vessel has a constrained cargo capacity (<capacity>) and must stay within a travel distance limit (<distance_limit>) to navigate safely in icy conditions. The vessels complete their routes at the final destination, ending their journeys there. The challenge is to plan efficient routes that distribute all equipment without exceeding capacity or distance constraints.
Reason: The problem description mentions a constrained cargo capacity and a travel distance limit, which directly correspond to the "C" (capacity) and "L" (distance limits) attributes. There is no mention of backhaul ("B" or "MB"), open routes ("O"), or time windows ("TW"). Given that the "C" attribute is typically ignored when other features are present, the most appropriate variant in this case is "VRPL", which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits.

Description: During a multi-city music festival, merchandise trucks (capacity <capacity>) depart from <loc_depot> to supply vendor booths (<loc_customer>) with branded goods (<demand_linehaul>) and later retrieve unsold items (<demand_backhaul>). Time windows (<time_windows>) are tied to performance schedules (e.g., "deliver before 10 AM at Stage 3, collect after 8 PM"). Routes must interleave deliveries and pickups based on real-time sales data while avoiding overcrowding at venues during peak hours.
Reason: The problem description includes capacity constraints, backhaul demand (collecting unsold items), and time window constraints (deliver before 10 AM, collect after 8 PM). The scenario also specifies that deliveries and pickups must be interleaved based on real-time sales data, implying a mixed backhaul situation where both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) can occur simultaneously. Given these requirements, the most fitting variant is 'VRPMBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows, including capacity constraints.

Description: A coastal logistics company manages daily redistribution of goods between floating markets (<loc_customer>) using boats that depart from a central hub (<loc_depot>). Each vessel has limited cargo space (<capacity>) and must serve markets during specific tidal windows (<time_windows>) when docks are accessible. Operations involve both delivering fresh produce (linehaul) and collecting unsold items (backhaul) in any order. Routes cannot exceed 50 nautical miles (<distance_limit>) due to fuel constraints. The solution must optimize this mixed-load routing while accommodating tidal schedules and capacity limits.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple critical attributes: capacity limits, mixed backhaul (linehaul and backhaul can be satisfied simultaneously), distance limit for the routes, and specific time windows during which service must be provided. The variant VRPMBLTW encompasses all these features: M for mixed backhaul, B indicating that backhaul demand can be served, L for distance limits, and TW for time window constraints. There is no mention of open routes, so the "O" prefix variants are not applicable.

Description: A farm supply company delivers feed to dairy farms (linehaul) and collects manure for compost (backhaul). Feed deliveries must reach farms by <time_window> to avoid livestock shortages, while manure pickups follow agricultural waste management schedules. Each truck holds <capacity> tons of feed and cannot travel more than <distance_limit> km to comply with driver hour regulations. Routes terminate at the last manure collection site to minimize detours.
Reason: The problem description mentions a time window for feed deliveries, distance limits for the trucks, and backhaul (manure collection) that can only be satisfied after linehaul (feed delivery) is completed. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.

Description: A movie studio coordinates equipment rentals for multiple shooting locations (<loc_customer>). Trucks depart from a rental warehouse (<loc_depot>) with mixed loads: delivering cameras/lighting (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting used props (<demand_backhaul>). Each location has narrow time windows (<time_windows>) aligned with shooting schedules. Vehicles have weight limits (<capacity>) and maximum daily operating hours (<time_limit>). Crews keep trucks overnight at the last location to avoid empty return trips.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple specific attributes: there is a need for both delivering and collecting items (mixed backhaul, 'MB'), each location has time windows ('TW') that must be adhered to, and the vehicles have weight limits and maximum daily operating hours, which can be interpreted as capacity and time constraints. Additionally, since the crews keep trucks overnight at the last location, it indicates an open route ('O'). Therefore, the variant that best fits this scenario is one that accounts for open routes, mixed backhaul, and time windows.

Description: A utility company deploys new power poles to remote areas (linehaul) and collects decommissioned poles (backhaul) for recycling. Delivery trucks must first install new poles before returning to retrieve old ones, with capacity limits for both pole types. Routes are restricted by maximum distance to ensure crews can return to the depot within a single shift, reducing operational costs. The challenge involves optimizing routes to balance pole weight and space while meeting distance constraints for efficient rural infrastructure management.
Reason: The problem description specifies that delivery trucks must first install new poles (linehaul) before collecting decommissioned ones (backhaul), indicating a backhaul condition. Additionally, there are capacity limits for both pole types and distance constraints to ensure crews can return to the depot within a single shift, which aligns with vehicle distance limits. Since there is no mention of open routes or time windows, the most fitting variant is VRPB, which accounts for backhaul demands after satisfying linehaul demands, and includes capacity and distance limitations.

Each road segment (node) has a time window during which it must be cleared (e.g., before morning rush hour). The location coordinates of road segments are <locs>, and each segment requires a service time <service_time> for clearing. Plows start and end at the central depot, which has a fixed operating window. Each plow has a maximum load capacity <capacity> tons of material and travels at <speed> km/h. The goal is to minimize total travel distance while ensuring all roads are cleared within their assigned time windows and without exceeding plow capacities.
Reason: <Error> at parse json

There is no mention of backhauls or mixed backhauls, nor any indication that the routes are open (i.e., plows do not return to the depot). Additionally, there is no explicit distance limit per vehicle, which rules out "L".

Routes are constrained to <distance_limit> km to minimize vibration exposure, with drivers ending at their final lab location.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the vehicles have a distance limit (<distance_limit> km) and that they handle both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) in mixed sequences, which implies that both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously. There is no mention of time windows or an open route, meaning the vehicles return to the depot. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches these characteristics is VRPMBL, where M stands for Mixed (linehaul and backhaul), B for Backhaul, and L for the distance Limit.

Trucks from the emergency depot at <loc_depot> have a capacity of <capacity> tons and must complete their routes within <distance_limit> kilometers. Routes are open-ended as crews remain at the last deployment site to assist. The objective is to ensure all materials are delivered on time without overloading trucks while minimizing total travel distance to maximize coverage.
Reason: The problem specifies that trucks have a capacity limit, must complete their routes within a distance limit, and each site has a critical time window for receiving supplies. Additionally, the routes are open-ended as crews remain at the last deployment site. These conditions match the characteristics of an Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Capacity, Distance Limit, and Time Window constraints (OVRPBLTW).

Each client has a demand for clean linens (`<demand_linehaul>`) and/or soiled linens to return (`<demand_backhaul>`). Routes must optimize the sequence of drop-offs and pickups to minimize travel distance, with drivers finishing at their final stop.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles have a capacity (`<capacity>`), and there is both a demand for clean linens (linehaul) and soiled linens to return (backhaul). The sequence of drop-offs and pickups must be optimized, implying that both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously. There's no mention of open routes, distance limits, or time window constraints, thus making 'VRPMB' the most fitting variant.

Vehicles transport both fresh drones (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieve units with captured imagery (<demand_backhaul>), constrained by charging station capacity (<capacity>). Routes dynamically interleave deployments and collections based on field readiness. Carriers remain at terminal fields overnight to minimize repositioning costs.
Reason: The problem description mentions the need to transport fresh drones (linehaul) and retrieve units with captured imagery (backhaul), which must be done in a way that considers charging station capacity. The description also indicates that backhaul demand is satisfied after linehaul, and there are time constraints based on field readiness. However, it does not specify vehicle distance limits or open routes, and the service does not continue beyond the day as carriers remain at terminal fields overnight, indicating a closed route. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows.

Description: A grocery chain operates in a city, delivering fresh produce to stores (linehaul) and collecting food waste for composting (backhaul). Deliveries must occur before stores open (TW), while pickups happen after closing hours (TW). Trucks (C) are limited in size to fit city streets, and routes must not exceed municipal distance limits (L) to reduce emissions. Drivers begin at the central depot, deliver produce, then collect waste, concluding at the depot for processing—without redundant returns to reduce fuel use.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: (1) the need for both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul), indicating a mixed backhaul ("MB") scenario; (2) there are specific time windows ("TW") for when deliveries and pickups must occur; (3) trucks have distance limits ("L") to adhere to municipal regulations. Since the vehicles start and end their routes at the central depot, this is not an open route. The combination of these factors points towards VRPMBLTW as the most fitting variant.

Delivery trucks (<capacity> kg capacity) must depart from a logistics hub (<loc_depot>), adhering to stringent time windows (<time_windows>) to avoid production halts. Routes must also respect <distance_limit> km limits to prevent overheating of climate-controlled cargo compartments.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks have a capacity limit, there are stringent time windows for deliveries, and routes must also respect distance limits. There is no mention of backhaul or open route conditions. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is one that includes capacity (C), time window constraints (TW), and distance limits (L).

Description: A home appliance retailer delivers new refrigerators, washing machines, and ovens to customers' homes (linehaul) while simultaneously collecting their old appliances for recycling (backhaul). Each delivery truck has a maximum capacity of <capacity> cubic meters. Routes must end at the final customer location (open routes), ensuring no return to the depot. Deliveries must precede pickups to avoid mixing loads. Customers specify time windows (<time_windows>) for service, such as weekday afternoons when they’re home. Routes are further constrained by a maximum allowable distance of <distance_limit> km to prevent driver fatigue. The goal is to minimize total travel distance while respecting all constraints.
Reason: The problem description specifies that deliveries (linehaul) must precede pickups (backhaul), indicating a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. The scenario also involves open routes, meaning the trucks do not return to the depot, and there are time window constraints for customer service. Additionally, there is a maximum allowable distance limit for each route to manage driver fatigue. These characteristics align with the "OVRPBTW" variant, which includes open routes (O), backhaul (B), and time windows (TW).

Description: A postal service operates a fleet of vehicles to deliver parcels to households and businesses while simultaneously collecting outgoing mail. Each vehicle has a capacity of <capacity> and must visit locations (<loc_customer>) with delivery demands (<demand_linehaul>) and pickup requests (<demand_backhaul>). Time windows (<time_windows>) ensure deliveries align with business hours, while route distances are capped at <distance_limit> to maintain efficiency. The goal is to minimize total travel time while ensuring all deliveries and pickups are completed within constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes vehicles with a capacity, time windows for deliveries, a distance limit for routes, and both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) demands that need to be satisfied. Since the backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met, this points towards a VRP variant with backhaul, time windows, and distance limits. The "O" (open route) attribute is not mentioned, implying that vehicles must return to the depot. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches these criteria is VRPBLTW.

Each site has specific time windows for installation and pickup. The vehicle’s capacity must handle both new and old panels without exceeding limits. The goal is efficient routing to minimize travel and meet all time constraints.
Reason: The problem description mentions specific time windows for installation and pickup, indicating 'TW' (time window constraints). It also specifies that the vehicle's capacity must handle both new and old panels, which suggests a 'MB' (mixed backhaul) scenario where both linehaul (delivery of new panels) and backhaul (retrieval of old panels) demands can be satisfied simultaneously.

Each truck (<capacity>) must first complete installations before pickups to ensure residents receive new systems on time. Time constraints require precise scheduling to handle both tasks within daylight hours, with routes concluding at the last recycling pickup location.
Reason: The problem description includes linehaul demand (installing new solar panels), backhaul demand (collecting old panels for recycling) with the requirement that all installations must be completed before any pickups, and there are time window constraints for morning and afternoon tasks. The need to conclude routes at the last recycling pickup location suggests that the routes are not open-ended. There is no mention of distance limits for the vehicles.

Vehicles (capacity: <capacity>) start at a warehouse (<loc_depot>) and finish routes at the final stop. Distance per route is capped at <distance_limit> km to meet same-day delivery promises. Mixed sequencing allows drivers to prioritize high-density areas flexibly.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles have a capacity constraint, there is both linehaul (delivering orders) and backhaul (collecting recyclable packaging) demand, and the vehicles have a distance limit. The description does not specify an open route or time windows, and it mentions mixed sequencing, which allows for simultaneous satisfaction of linehaul and backhaul demands, making "MB" (mixed backhaul) the most fitting attribute. The distance limitation per route to meet same-day delivery promises aligns with the "L" (distance limits) feature. Therefore, the variant that best fits these criteria is VRPMBL.

Each venue demands a specific volume of equipment (<demand>). Delivery trucks are limited to a maximum load of <capacity> cubic meters. The goal is to plan routes that prevent overloading while minimizing travel distance. Drivers finish their shifts at the last venue, streamlining operations and reducing fuel costs.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each delivery truck is limited to a maximum load of <capacity> cubic meters, which directly relates to the capacity constraint. It also specifies the need to minimize travel distance, but does not mention any backhaul, vehicle distance limits, time windows, or open routes. Therefore, the most fitting variant is CVRP, where C stands for capacity constraints.

All deliveries must occur before pickups to ensure trails are cleared only after maintenance crews have secured the area. Vehicles departing from <loc_depot> face <capacity> limits for both supplies and waste. Routes are capped at <distance_limit> kilometers to prevent overexertion in rugged terrain, with crews concluding shifts at the final cleanup site.
Reason: The problem description specifies that there are both linehaul (transporting repair tools and safety gear) and backhaul (collecting litter and discarded camping equipment) demands, with the condition that all deliveries (linehaul) must occur before pickups (backhaul). Additionally, vehicles have a distance limit for their routes. There is no mention of open routes or specific time window constraints, hence we do not include "O" or "TW" in our classification. The presence of capacity limits is also noted but is considered standard and thus not a differentiating factor when combined with other attributes. Therefore, the most fitting variant is VRPBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauling and Distance Limits.

Vehicles (<capacity> kg) must deliver equipment before <time_window> start times to avoid delays in site operations. After crews finish shifts, trucks return to the same sites to collect gear, ensuring no pickups occur until all deliveries are complete. The <service_time> includes safety inspections at each site, requiring precise scheduling to meet strict occupational health deadlines.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles have a capacity limit, and there are strict time windows for deliveries to avoid delays in site operations. Additionally, it mentions that backhaul (collection of used gear) only occurs after all deliveries (linehaul) are complete, which aligns with the "B" backhaul condition where backhaul demand can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is met. The presence of time window constraints ("TW") and the backhaul condition ("B") without any mention of open routes or distance limits on the vehicles points to VRPBTW as the most fitting variant.

Testing (delivery) and PPE collection (pickup) can be interleaved. Routes terminate at the final stop.
Reason: The problem description mentions a central hub (depot) from which vehicles depart and return, indicating that the routes are not open. It also specifies that the vehicles have a capacity limit, and that there are time windows within which the vehicles must arrive at each location. Additionally, the task involves both delivering testing (linehaul) and collecting PPE (backhaul), and these activities can be interleaved, suggesting a mixed backhaul scenario. The presence of time windows and mixed backhaul, along with capacity constraints, points to the VRPMBTW variant as the most specific and appropriate classification.

The system prioritizes efficient space utilization in vehicles, with drivers ending shifts after their last theater visit.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the transport vans have a specific capacity, which is indicated by the "C" in the variants. It also specifies that the system manages both delivering period-specific props (linehaul) and retrieving unused items (backhaul), with no explicit mention that backhaul can only be done after linehaul, suggesting a mixed backhaul scenario, denoted by "MB". There is no mention of distance limits for the vehicles ("L"), nor any time window constraints for deliveries or pickups ("TW").

Description: A network of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations requires regular battery swaps for taxis and delivery fleets. Service vans (capacity <capacity>) depart from a central depot (<loc_depot>) to:  
- Deliver fresh batteries (<demand_linehaul>) to stations at <loc_customer>  
- Collect depleted batteries (<demand_backhaul>) from the same or different stations  
Routes must optimize the sequence of deliveries/pickups while respecting:  
✓ Vehicle weight limits when carrying both fresh and dead batteries  
✓ Maximum daily travel distance (<distance_limit>) due to shift constraints  
✓ Mixed ordering (some stations may need delivery before pickup, others vice versa)

**Scenario 2:** Antarctic Research Station Resupply & Waste Evacuation  
A supply ship coordinates ice-road truck routes from coastal depot (<loc_depot>) to:  
- Deliver fuel/equipment (<demand_linehaul>) to <num_customer> inland bases  
- Retrieve experimental waste (<demand_backhaul>) for offshore disposal  
Critical constraints:  
✓ Vehicles must complete round trips within <distance_limit> due to extreme weather windows  
✓ Cargo capacity (<capacity>) must account for combined supplies and waste  
✓ Mixed sequencing - some bases require immediate waste removal before accepting new supplies  
```

**Scenario 3:** Urban Vertical Farm Nutrient Delivery & Harvest Collection  
Hydroponic skyscraper farms require daily logistics from a processing center (<loc_depot>):  
- Deliver liquid nutrients (<demand_linehaul>) to towers at <loc_customer>  
- Collect mature produce (<demand_backhaul>) for distribution  
Routing challenges:  
✓ Refrigerated trucks have strict weight (<capacity>) and distance (<distance_limit>) limits  
✓ Some towers may require harvest before accepting new nutrients to free storage space  
✓ Time-sensitive perishables demand efficient mixed-order routing  
```

**Scenario 4:** Fishing Fleet Support Vessel Routing Problem  
A mothership (<loc_depot>) coordinates supply runs to <num_customer> fishing boats:  
- Deliver ice/fuel (<demand_linehaul>)  
- Collect catches (<demand_backhaul>) for processing  
Operational constraints:  
✓ Support vessels have cold storage capacity (<capacity>) for both supplies and fish  
✓ Must complete all operations within <distance_limit> due to fuel constraints  
✓ Dynamic sequencing - some boats need fuel before surrendering catch, others vice versa  
```

```
**Scenario 5:** Hazardous Chemical Delivery & Waste Collection Problem  
Specialized tanker trucks operate from a depot (<loc_depot>) to:  
- Deliver industrial chemicals (<demand_linehaul>) to factories  
- Collect spent solvents (<demand_backhaul>) for recycling  
Safety-driven requirements:  
✓ Strict compartmentalized capacity (<capacity>) for different hazard classes  
✓ Routes limited to <distance_limit> to minimize accident risks  
✓ Flexible sequencing - some facilities require waste removal before accepting new chemicals  
```

Each scenario emphasizes:  
- **C**: Explicit capacity constraints for combined loads

Description: A marketing firm rotates digital billboard displays (<loc_customer>) across city locations using trucks with <capacity> display panels. Each site has specific installation time slots (<time_windows>) to avoid peak traffic. Routes must finish within <time_limit> hours due to daylight constraints. Trucks depart from the warehouse (<loc_depot>) but remain at their final location for overnight security. Mixed operations allow simultaneous removal of old ads (backhaul) and installation of new ones (linehaul) at each stop.
Reason: The problem description mentions that trucks have a capacity for display panels, which is indicated by "C". It also specifies that each site has specific installation time slots, indicating the presence of "TW" (time window constraints). The scenario allows for mixed operations, meaning both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, which is denoted by "MB". Additionally, the routes must finish within a certain time limit due to daylight constraints, reinforcing the need for "TW". However, there is no explicit mention of distance limits ("L") or open routes where vehicles do not return to the depot at the end of the day. Therefore, the most appropriate variant considering all these factors is "VRPMBTW".

Description: A company specializes in setting up temporary amusement parks for festivals and events. Their trucks must deliver heavy ride components (e.g., carousels, Ferris wheels) to event locations (linehaul) and later retrieve dismantled equipment for storage or reuse (backhaul). Each vehicle has a maximum capacity <capacity>, so planners must ensure that the combined weight of delivered items and retrieved equipment doesn’t exceed this limit. The challenge is designing routes that minimize total distance while respecting the delivery-first requirement—rides must be fully deployed before any equipment is collected. The locations of the central warehouse and event sites is <locs>, with delivery demand <demand_linehaul> and retrieval demand <demand_backhaul> per site.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks must deliver heavy ride components (linehaul) and later retrieve dismantled equipment (backhaul) with a requirement that all deliveries are completed before any backhauls begin. This matches the "B" (backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met) feature. Additionally, there is a mention of each vehicle having a maximum capacity, which aligns with the "C" (capacity) feature. Since no specific time window or open route requirements were mentioned, and distance limits on vehicles were not specified, the most fitting variant is CVRPB.

Description: During a pandemic, a medical logistics team deploys ventilators and PPE kits from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>) to isolated clinics (<loc_customer>). After ensuring all deliveries (linehaul) are completed, the trucks collect contaminated medical waste from the clinics for safe disposal. The route must prioritize deliveries before pickups to prevent cross-contamination. Each truck adheres to its <capacity> kg limit and concludes its route at the final waste pickup location.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the trucks must deliver (linehaul) ventilators and PPE kits before collecting (backhaul) contaminated medical waste, which aligns with the "B" attribute where backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, each truck has a capacity limit, which is represented by the "C" attribute. There is no mention of distance limits, open routes, mixed backhaul, or time window constraints, so these attributes ("L", "O", "MB", "TW") are not applicable. Therefore, the most fitting variant is CVRPB.

Description: A nonprofit organization operates a fleet of mobile pet adoption vans that visit neighborhoods (<loc_customer>) to showcase adoptable animals while also accepting surrendered pets. Each van has a limited capacity (<capacity>) for animals and must adhere to strict time windows (<time_windows>) at each stop due to local regulations. Deliveries (adoptions) and pickups (surrenders) can occur in any order. Vans conclude their routes at the final stop without returning to the shelter (<loc_depot>), minimizing stress for the animals.
Reason: The problem involves a fleet of vehicles with limited capacity (C), strict time windows at each stop (TW), and the requirement that the vans do not return to the shelter after completing their routes, making it an open route (O). The scenario does not mention specific distance limits for the vehicles (L) or backhaul (B) and mixed backhaul (MB) conditions. Therefore, the most fitting variant is OVRPTW which combines the features of open route, capacity, and time window constraints.

Description: A chemical company services automotive factories (<loc_customer>) from its plant (<loc_depot>) using tanker trucks (capacity <capacity>). Each stop requires either delivering fresh paint (<demand_linehaul>) or collecting hazardous waste containers (<demand_backhaul>). Routes are open-ended with technicians staying overnight at their last location, and each truck's route is capped at <distance_limit> km due to hazardous material transport regulations.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each truck route is capped at a certain distance (<distance_limit>), indicating a distance limit (L). It also specifies that routes are open-ended, meaning vehicles do not have to return to the depot (O). The tasks include both delivering fresh paint and collecting hazardous waste, but there is no specific indication that backhaul can only occur after all linehaul demands are met, nor is there any mention of mixed backhaul where both types of demand can be satisfied simultaneously. Additionally, there is no mention of time windows for service (TW). Based on these characteristics, the most appropriate variant from the list is OVRPL, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits.

Description: A meteorological agency needs to launch weather balloons equipped with sensors to monitor atmospheric conditions over mountainous terrain. The balloons are launched from a central base (<loc_depot>), and each must carry a payload of sensors (<demand>) within the balloon’s capacity (<capacity>). Due to wind patterns and battery limits, balloons can only drift within a specific maximum distance (<distance_limit>) from the launch site. Teams must plan routes to ensure all monitoring points (<loc_customer>) are covered without exceeding payload limits or drifting beyond the allowed range.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the balloons have a payload capacity constraint, and they can only drift within a specific maximum distance from the launch site. This implies a vehicle routing problem with both capacity (C) and distance limit (L) constraints. There is no mention of backhaul (B or MB), open routes (O), or time window (TW) constraints. Thus, the most fitting variant is VRPL, which accounts for the distance limits while the capacity constraint is inherently included in the base VRP formulation.

Sites require installation during maintenance windows (time windows) to avoid service disruptions. Technicians have an 8-hour working shift (duration limit), and trucks must prioritize deliveries before pickups to prevent blocking access to tower sites. Capacity constraints demand careful scheduling to avoid overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the technicians have an 8-hour working shift (duration limit) and sites require installation during maintenance windows (time windows), which aligns with the "TW" (time window constraints) feature. Additionally, it mentions that trucks must prioritize deliveries before pickups to avoid blocking access, and capacity constraints demand careful scheduling, indicating both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) demands are present and need to be managed together, fitting the "MB" (mixed backhaul) attribute. There is no mention of open routes or distance limits for vehicles, thus the most suitable variant is VRPMBTW.

Each clinic requires medical supplies, equipment, and staff gear (<demand> kg), loaded onto trucks starting from the aid hub (<loc_depot>). Each vehicle has a maximum capacity (<capacity> kg) to prevent overloading. Once all supplies are delivered to the final clinic site, the truck stays there to support operations. The goal is to optimize routes so every clinic gets its full allocation without exceeding truck capacities, while reducing overall driving distances to save fuel and time.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each truck has a maximum capacity to prevent overloading, and the goal is to optimize routes so every clinic gets its full allocation without exceeding these capacities. It also specifies reducing overall driving distances to save fuel and time, which implies an interest in minimizing travel distance but does not explicitly mention fixed vehicle distance limits or time windows for service.

Routes must also be planned to ensure buses return to the central hub <loc_depot> within <distance_limit> km to avoid delays in subsequent shifts. The objective is to optimize routes for on-time passenger transfers without exceeding vehicle limits or route distances.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the shuttle buses have a seating capacity constraint, there are time window constraints for boarding, and each bus must return to the central hub within a certain distance limit. The requirement for vehicles to return to a central hub indicates this is not an open route variant (O). There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, so variants with B or MB do not apply.

Trucks depart from a central commissary (<loc_depot>), must arrive at each restaurant within their designated service hours (<time_windows>), and cannot exceed capacity limits for both deliveries and pickups. The route design must ensure ingredients are dropped off first, followed by dish collection, with drivers concluding their day at the last stop.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks must arrive at each restaurant within designated service hours, indicating time window constraints (TW). It also mentions that fresh ingredients (linehaul) need to be delivered before collecting empty dishware (backhaul), with the requirement that ingredients are dropped off first and dish collection happens afterward. This indicates a backhaul demand (B) that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met. The route design starts from a central commissary and ends at the last stop, which means it is not an open route (O). Capacity limits for both deliveries and pickups are mentioned, but since other specific features (TW, B) are present, the capacity constraint (C) does not change the classification. No mention of distance limits (L) for the vehicles was made. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBTW.

Description: A tool rental company must deliver construction equipment to job sites and collect returned tools from customers. Each route starts at the central warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering tools (linehaul) to customers (<loc_customer>) based on rental requests (<demand_linehaul>). After all deliveries, the vehicle proceeds to collect returned tools (backhaul) from other customers (<demand_backhaul>). The truck’s capacity (<capacity>) must not exceed during combined deliveries and pickups. Routes end at the final collection point to avoid redundant travel.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the truck’s capacity must not be exceeded during combined deliveries and pickups, which indicates a capacity constraint (C). It also specifies that each route starts at the central warehouse and ends at the final collection point, implying that the routes are closed, not open. The scenario includes both delivering tools to customers and collecting returned tools, with the backhaul demand being satisfied after all linehaul demands, indicating a backhaul feature (B). There is no mention of distance limits or time window constraints, so these features (L and TW) are not considered. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPB, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul.

Time windows (<time_windows>) reflect office hours. Drivers conclude routes at the last office visited. The problem requires optimizing mixed delivery/pickup sequences to minimize travel distance without exceeding capacity or missing time windows.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (delivering and collecting devices), has a capacity limit, and includes time window constraints for deliveries and pickups. The routes are open, as drivers conclude at the last office visited, rather than returning to the depot. There is no mention of distance limits for the vehicles, which rules out the "L" variants. Given these specifics, the most fitting variant that encompasses all mentioned aspects (mixed backhaul, capacity, time windows, and open routes) is VRPMBLTW.

Technicians in vans (capacity: <capacity>) from a central hub (<loc_depot>) can perform tasks in any order, but routes are capped at <distance_limit> km due to the technicians' shift durations.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the vans have a capacity, there is a need for both delivering replacement parts (linehaul) and retrieving depleted batteries (backhaul), and routes are capped at a certain distance. The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after the linehaul demand, which aligns with the "B" feature. Additionally, the presence of a distance limit for the routes corresponds to the "L" feature.

Description: A film production company must deliver heavy camera rigs, lighting setups, and props to remote outdoor filming locations. Each site has a strict time window during which crew members are available to unload and assemble equipment. Delivery trucks starting from the equipment warehouse (<loc_depot>) must adhere to weight limits (<capacity> tons) to avoid overloading. Routes must not exceed a daily distance limit (<distance_limit> km) to ensure drivers comply with labor regulations. Since filming crews will repurpose the trucks as temporary storage, vehicles do not return to the depot after deliveries. The goal is to plan routes that respect time windows (TW), capacity (C), and distance limits (L) while minimizing total travel distance.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks must adhere to weight limits, have a daily distance limit, and respect time windows for unloading. Additionally, it is mentioned that the vehicles do not return to the depot after deliveries, indicating an open route. These constraints map directly to capacity (C), distance limits (L), time window constraints (TW), and open routes (O).

Each truck has a limited capacity (<capacity> kg) to balance the weight of clean linens (linehaul) and dirty laundry (backhaul). Routes must first deliver clean supplies to hotels before collecting the used items, as soiled linens cannot be stored alongside clean ones. Vehicles complete their routes at the final hotel visited, reducing operational downtime. The challenge is to design efficient paths that prevent overloading while ensuring all hotels are serviced.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles have a limited capacity, and there is a backhaul demand (collecting soiled linens) that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands (delivering clean linens) are met. There is no mention of open routes, distance limits, or time windows. The most fitting variant is VRPB, as it specifically deals with capacity constraints and backhaul demand conditions as described.

Delivery trucks (<capacity> kg capacity) must carry perishable goods without overloading and complete their routes within <distance_limit> km to minimize spoilage. Drivers end their shifts at the final stop, and routes must be planned to meet time windows while optimizing freshness and cost efficiency.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key attributes: the delivery trucks have a capacity limit, each food bank has a time window for deliveries to ensure food stays cold, and there is a distance limit for the routes. The open route feature (drivers end their shifts at the final stop) is also mentioned, but since we are focusing on the most specific variant that matches all given constraints, the presence of capacity, time windows, and distance limits are the primary factors. The backhaul (B) or mixed backhaul (MB) features are not specifically indicated as part of the requirements.

Description: A polar research team resupplies remote Antarctic outposts with food, fuel, and scientific tools (linehaul) while retrieving ice core samples and waste (backhaul). Deliveries and pickups must align with narrow time windows dictated by seasonal weather windows and aircraft availability. Flights have strict 6-hour round-trip limits (duration limit) due to fuel constraints, and cargo capacities are tightly regulated to balance weight between outbound and inbound loads.
Reason: The problem description mentions both linehaul (delivering food, fuel, and scientific tools) and backhaul (retrieving ice core samples and waste) activities, which must be balanced. There are strict time windows for deliveries and pickups due to seasonal weather and aircraft availability, indicating a need for time window constraints. Additionally, there is a 6-hour round-trip limit, suggesting distance or duration limits. Since the vehicles have to return to the depot after each trip, it is not an open route. The capacity of the flights is regulated, but this is already covered by the other more specific constraints. Thus, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBLTW, representing mixed backhaul, with distance or duration limits, and time window constraints.

Shelters operate within specific time windows when volunteers are present. Vehicles must prioritize deliveries before pickups, ensuring capacities are not exceeded for both supplies and waste, while navigating time-sensitive routes to maximize aid efficiency.
Reason: The problem description specifies several key attributes: 1) Both linehaul (delivering supplies) and backhaul (collecting waste) operations are involved, with a requirement that deliveries must be prioritized over pickups, suggesting a mixed backhaul scenario. 2) There are specific time windows when shelters can be serviced, indicating the presence of time window constraints. 3) The need to manage capacities for both supplies and waste, though this is typically covered by other more specific features like 'MB' or 'B'.

Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery of equipment (linehaul) must precede the pickup of samples (backhaul), indicating a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there is a capacity constraint for the vehicles to handle the weight of delicate instruments and fragile samples.

Balance keg inventory across routes while minimizing travel distance and avoiding overloads.
Reason: The problem involves a brewery (depot) that distributes kegs to bars (customers) and retrieves empty kegs (backhaul). The description specifies that each bar’s demand for kegs and the return of empties fluctuate daily, indicating mixed backhaul (MB) where both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously.

Reason: The problem description mentions that installation trucks (capacity) are used to both install new park benches (linehaul) and remove damaged ones (backhaul), with the condition that these tasks can be mixed in any order, indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, each route has a distance limit, which corresponds to the "L" attribute. There is no mention of time windows or the need for open routes, so the "TW" and "O" attributes are not applicable. Given these conditions, the most specific variant that fits this scenario is VRPMBL.

Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 15
Description: A rental company delivers equipment (e.g., tools, generators) to customers for short-term use and later collects the returned items. Each vehicle has a capacity of <capacity> kg. Deliveries must occur first, followed by pickups at designated return locations. Customers have strict time windows <time_windows> for receiving deliveries or dropping off returns, enforced by their operational schedules. The service team must plan routes ensuring all deliveries are made before pickups, vehicles don’t exceed their weight limits, and time windows are respected to avoid penalties.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each vehicle has a capacity limit, deliveries must occur before pickups (indicating backhaul demand after linehaul), and there are strict time windows for both deliveries and pickups. These attributes match the characteristics of the VRPMBTW variant, which includes mixed backhaul (both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously) and time window constraints.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 27
Description: A rotating pop-up shop network requires daily inventory redistribution. Vans (capacity <capacity> units) depart from a warehouse (<loc_depot>) to deliver new stock (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieve unsold items (<demand_backhaul>) from temporary locations (<loc_customer>). Tight time windows (<time_windows>) align with mall access hours. Drivers end routes at assigned overnight parking to avoid empty returns, respecting shift duration limits (<time_limit> hours).
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: capacity constraints (vans with a specific unit capacity), backhaul demand (retrieving unsold items), and time window constraints (tight time windows aligning with mall access hours). Additionally, the routes are open-ended as drivers end their routes at assigned overnight parking, indicating an 'open' route. However, since the backhaul can only be performed after the linehaul is satisfied, this fits the 'B' (backhaul) rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul) variant. The presence of time windows ('TW') is also a critical factor. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRPBTW'.

Label: OVRP, Predicted: CVRP, Index: 44
Description: A renewable energy company transports turbine blades and nacelles to offshore wind farm installation sites. Each component has a specific weight, and barges (<loc_depot>) have limited cargo capacity (<capacity>). Routes must deliver all components to their respective sites (<loc_customer>), with crews staying on-site post-delivery to aid assembly. The goal is to plan routes that ensure no barge exceeds its capacity while minimizing travel time and fuel consumption across all deliveries.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each barge has a limited cargo capacity, and the goal is to ensure no barge exceeds its capacity. There is no mention of backhaul demand, distance limits for the barges, or specific time windows for delivery. The routes do not need to be open as the description does not specify that the barges do not return to the depot. Therefore, the most fitting variant is CVRP, which stands for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, focusing on the capacity constraint of the vehicles (barges in this case).

Description: A ski resort operator delivers snowboards, helmets, and boots (linehaul) to rental shops at mountain bases before peak visitor hours (time windows). After the day’s rentals, trucks collect used gear (backhaul) from multiple locations. Vehicles face <capacity> limits for bulky equipment and must navigate rugged terrain within a <distance_limit> km radius to return before evening closures. Time windows for pickups align with resort operating hours, necessitating efficient backhaul sequencing after deliveries.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key attributes that help in identifying the most specific variant. The ski resort operator needs to deliver and collect equipment, indicating a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario where both linehaul and backhaul demands are handled. There is a capacity limit for the vehicles, and they must navigate within a distance limit (L). Additionally, there are time window constraints (TW) for both deliveries and pickups, which align with the resort's operating hours. The requirement for efficient backhaul sequencing after deliveries suggests that the backhaul demand can only be satisfied once the linehaul demand is met, but since the problem also involves handling both simultaneously, 'MB' is more appropriate than 'B'. The description does not suggest an open route (O), as the vehicles need to return before evening closures. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the given problem is VRPMBLTW.

Description: A municipal arborist team delivers saplings (<demand_linehaul>) to planting sites (<loc_customer>) and removes invasive plants (<demand_backhaul>) in the same trip. Electric trucks (<capacity> load limit) start at a nursery (<loc_depot>), blend tasks to minimize deadheading, and end routes on-site due to battery range constraints (<distance_limit> km).
Reason: The problem description specifies that the electric trucks have a distance limit and must end their routes on-site due to battery range constraints, which aligns with the 'L' (distance limits) feature. Additionally, it mentions that the team delivers saplings (linehaul demand) and removes invasive plants (backhaul demand) in the same trip, indicating the presence of mixed backhaul demands ('MB'). There is no mention of time windows for service or the requirement for the vehicles to return to the depot, thus excluding 'TW' and 'O'. The capacity constraint is mentioned but does not need to be explicitly labeled as 'C' since other specific features ('MB', 'L') are present.

Description: A farming cooperative uses trucks (capacity: `<capacity>`) to distribute fresh produce from a hub (`<loc_depot>`) to markets (`<loc_customer>`, demand: `<demand_linehaul>`) while simultaneously collecting empty crates/used equipment (`<demand_backhaul>`). Routes must prioritize efficiency (minimize distance) and avoid overloading, with drivers ending at their last stop (e.g., a mechanic for equipment maintenance). Each route is capped at `<distance_limit>` km due to perishability constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes capacity constraints, backhaul demand that is collected after all linehaul demands are met, and a distance limit for each route. Additionally, the routes are open, meaning drivers do not return to the depot but end at their last stop. These characteristics match the definition of the OVRPBL variant, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Linehaul, and where vehicles have distance limits.

Description: A retail chain’s warehouse (`<loc_depot>`) sends trucks (capacity: `<capacity>`) to restock `<num_customer>` stores (`<loc_customer>`, demand: `<demand_linehaul>`) and collect defective items (`<demand_backhaul>`). Routes can mix deliveries and pickups (e.g., deliver to Store A, pick up from Store B, then deliver to Store C). Vehicles must stay within `<distance_limit>` km to meet driver shift limits and end routes at the final store for unloading.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the vehicles must stay within a certain distance limit (`<distance_limit>`), which aligns with the "L" (limited distance) attribute. Additionally, it specifies that routes can mix deliveries and pickups, indicating "MB" (mixed backhaul). Since there is no mention of time windows or the requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, the most fitting variant is VRPMBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Limited Distance.

Description: A machinery rental firm serves construction crews working in remote areas (<loc_customer>, etc.), delivering bulldozers, generators, and tools from its central yard (<loc_depot>). Each job site demands specific equipment with combined weight requirements (<demand> kg). Rental trucks have fixed capacities (<capacity> kg) to ensure safe transport. After dropping off the last piece of equipment, drivers halt at the final site to await further instructions. The challenge is to design routes that fit all equipment within truck limits, avoid unnecessary detours, and ensure every worksite receives its machinery without return trips to the depot.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each job site demands specific equipment with combined weight requirements, and the rental trucks have fixed capacities to ensure safe transport. This clearly indicates a capacity constraint. There is no mention of backhaul (B or MB), distance limits (L), time windows (TW), or open routes (O) in the provided scenario. Therefore, the most fitting variant from the list, given these conditions, is CVRP, which stands for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, focusing on the capacity constraints without additional complications like backhauls, limited distances, time windows, or open routes.

After filming concludes, they collect the equipment from each site (backhaul). Each location has strict time windows for setup and teardown (e.g., sunrise for dawn scenes, dusk for night shoots). Delivery trucks must first complete all deliveries before initiating pickups, ensuring no vehicle exceeds its maximum capacity (<capacity>). The goal is to optimize routes so that all equipment arrives on time, adheres to the sequence of deliveries followed by pickups, and ends at the final stop without returning to the depot.

Description: An outdoor advertising company services digital billboards (<loc_customer>) by uploading new ads (<demand_linehaul>) and removing malfunctioning display panels (<demand_backhaul>). Technicians with equipment vans (<capacity>) depart from a media hub (<loc_depot>), freely sequencing maintenance tasks. Each route is limited to <distance_limit> km to ensure same-day completion, with crews leaving vehicles at the final billboard site.
Reason: The problem description mentions a distance limit for each route, which corresponds to the 'L' (distance limits) attribute. Additionally, it involves both uploading new ads (linehaul demand) and removing malfunctioning display panels (backhaul demand), but specifies that these activities are carried out freely without a strict sequence, implying that backhaul can only be satisfied after linehaul, fitting the 'B' (backhaul) characteristic. The crews leave their vehicles at the final billboard site, indicating an open route, which matches the 'O' (open route) attribute. No specific time windows for service are mentioned, so 'TW' is not applicable. Therefore, the most appropriate variant that covers all these features is OVRPB (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls).

Each van has a limited cargo space (<capacity> cubic meters). Design routes that maximize space utilization without overloading any vehicle, and allow drivers to finish their routes at the final delivery address. The goal is to minimize total driving distance while ensuring every home receives its furniture.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each van has a limited cargo space (capacity) and the goal is to maximize space utilization without overloading any vehicle. There are no specific mentions of backhauls, distance limits for vehicles, open routes, or time windows. Thus, the most fitting variant is CVRP, which stands for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, focusing on capacity constraints.

Description: A public health initiative operates temporary clinics in underserved areas. Each clinic requires medical supplies (linehaul deliveries) from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>), and after operations, used equipment must be retrieved (backhaul pickups). Clinics have strict operating hours (<time_windows>) to accommodate patient availability, and each site specifies a service time (<service_time>) for setup/teardown. Vehicles (<capacity> kg capacity) must first deliver supplies to all assigned clinics before returning to collect equipment, ensuring no vehicle exceeds its load limit. Routes end at the final clinic visited, avoiding return trips to the warehouse.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vehicles must deliver supplies (linehaul) to all clinics before collecting used equipment (backhaul), indicating a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands. It also mentions strict operating hours for the clinics, which translates to time window constraints. The routes end at the final clinic visited, without returning to the warehouse, indicating an open route. There is no mention of distance limits for the vehicles. Based on these attributes, the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, and Time Windows, in an open route setting.

Delivery vehicles (<capacity>) start at the foundation’s warehouse (<loc_depot>), first distributing supplies to schools (<loc_customer>). After all deliveries, they proceed to collect artworks from the same schools, prioritizing weight and space constraints. The goal is to plan routes that minimize travel distance while adhering to truck capacities and ensuring no artwork is collected before supplies are fully distributed. Vehicles end their routes at the final collection point.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles have a capacity constraint, which is covered by "C". More importantly, it specifies that backhaul (collecting finished student artworks) can only be done after all linehaul (distributing art supplies) demands are satisfied, which fits the "B" characteristic. There is no mention of open routes, distance limits for the vehicles, or specific time window constraints in the description. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is CVRPB, where "C" stands for capacity and "B" indicates the backhaul demand must wait until all linehaul deliveries are completed.

Vehicles depart from a central warehouse, first delivering medical kits, food, and water (linehaul) to disaster zones (must arrive within specific time windows to prioritize urgent needs). After deliveries, they proceed to collect medical waste or debris (backhaul) from designated sites. Each vehicle has a limited capacity, ensuring supplies and waste do not exceed the load. Routes must stay within a maximum distance to avoid overextending teams, and deliveries must precede pickups to ensure timely aid distribution. The goal is to minimize travel distance while adhering to time constraints and operational limits.
Reason: The problem description specifies that vehicles must deliver supplies (linehaul) and then collect waste (backhaul), with backhaul only occurring after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, the problem includes time window constraints for deliveries, vehicle capacity limits, and maximum travel distance restrictions. These features match the characteristics of VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Linehaul, Time Windows, and limited Distance.

Deliveries must be completed before pickups to prevent overloading trucks and ensure all items are available for their scheduled performances. Vehicles depart from the warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering the requested gear (<demand_linehaul>) to concert halls or theaters, then collecting returned equipment (<demand_backhaul>) from locations such as bars or festivals. Routes end at the final pickup point, avoiding unnecessary return trips to the depot. The challenge is balancing load capacity (<capacity>) and optimizing routes to serve all clients efficiently.
Reason: The problem description indicates that deliveries (linehaul) must be completed before pickups (backhaul), implying a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands. This aligns with the "B" characteristic. Additionally, there is a mention of balancing load capacity, which is represented by the "C" feature.

Delivery windows align with venue setup hours, while pickup windows are scheduled post-event. The goal is to optimize routes to minimize fuel costs while adhering to time constraints and capacity limits.
Reason: The problem involves deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) with the condition that all equipment must be retrieved after events. This indicates a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, there are strict time windows for both deliveries and pickups, which aligns with the TW (time window constraints). Capacity limits of trucks are also mentioned, but this is typically covered under the base VRP variants when other features like MB and TW are present, so a specific C designation is not necessary.

Capacity limits on supplies and waste require precise route planning, ending at the final station to expedite post-race cleanup.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the logistics team must deliver supplies (linehaul) to aid stations and then collect waste (backhaul) after, ensuring all deliveries are completed before pickups. This matches the "B" attribute for backhaul. Additionally, there are strict time windows ("TW") for both delivery and collection, indicating a need for service within specific time frames. The capacity constraints on supplies and waste also suggest a "C" aspect, but since "B" and "TW" are present, the "C" is implied and not separately listed.

Service vessels, limited by their cargo capacity (<capacity>) and maximum operational distance (<distance_limit> nautical miles), must first deliver supplies before returning along the same route to collect debris. Routes are planned as open paths, concluding at the furthest rig to minimize fuel waste. The challenge is to sequence deliveries and pickups efficiently, ensuring rig operations are uninterrupted while adhering to strict weight and distance constraints.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the service vessels have both a cargo capacity limit and a maximum operational distance, which corresponds to the "C" and "L" attributes.

Reason: The problem description specifies several key constraints: (1) the need to deliver turbine components and retrieve installation equipment, which implies a mixed backhaul scenario (MB); (2) strict time windows for operations at each site due to weather and tidal conditions (TW); (3) a capacity constraint on the delivery trucks (C). The requirement that all deliveries must be completed before retrieving equipment supports the MB variant over B. Additionally, there is no mention of distance limits for the vehicles or that the routes are open (not returning to the depot), so L and O variants are not applicable. Considering these factors, VRPMBTW is the most appropriate variant as it encompasses all specified constraints.

Description: Electric hearses (capacity: <capacity>) coordinate eco-friendly burials by delivering biodegradable caskets to families (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting floral tributes for composting (<demand_backhaul>) across cemeteries (<loc_customer>). Narrow time windows (<time_windows>) reflect funeral ceremony schedules. Routes respect cultural protocols (e.g., never transporting caskets and flowers simultaneously) while optimizing for battery range.
Reason: The problem description mentions specific capacities for the electric hearses, narrow time windows reflecting funeral ceremony schedules, and the need to coordinate both deliveries (biodegradable caskets) and collections (floral tributes) while respecting cultural protocols that prevent carrying caskets and flowers simultaneously. This indicates a need for backhaul demand ('B') after linehaul demand is satisfied, as well as time window constraints ('TW'). The presence of these features and the context of the problem aligns best with the VRPBTW variant, which includes capacity, backhaul, and time window constraints.

Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 42
Description: A seafood company services offshore aquaculture cages (<loc_customer>) using boats that deliver feed (<demand_linehaul>) and harvest mature fish (<demand_backhaul>). Vessels with <capacity> ton limits must navigate tidal time windows (<time_windows>) when cages are accessible, completing routes within <time_limit> hours due to crew safety regulations. The mixed sequence of deliveries/pickups is constrained by perishability timelines for both feed and fresh catch.
Reason: The problem involves a mix of linehaul (delivering feed) and backhaul (harvesting fish) demands, with specific capacity constraints for the vessels, and the need to operate within certain tidal time windows. Additionally, there is no mention of the routes being open, meaning the boats likely return to the depot after completing their tasks. The critical elements here are the mixed backhaul (MB), capacity (C), and time window (TW) constraints, which align best with the VRPMBTW variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPL, Predicted: CVRP, Index: 47
Description: A humanitarian organization delivers perishable food supplies (e.g., refrigerated vaccines, fresh produce) to remote rainforest communities. The central warehouse is at <loc_depot>, and the communities are at <loc_customer>. Each community requires <demand> kg of perishable goods, but refrigerated trucks can carry up to <capacity> kg. The trucks must return to the depot within <distance_limit> km to maintain food/fuel freshness and avoid spoilage in tropical heat. Plan routes ensuring all supplies are delivered without exceeding capacity or distance limits.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks have a capacity limit and must return to the depot within a certain distance limit to maintain the freshness of the perishable goods. This indicates the presence of both capacity ("C") and distance ("L") constraints. There is no mention of backhaul demands, mixed backhaul, or time windows, nor is there an indication that the routes are open (not returning to the depot). Thus, the most fitting variant is "VRPL" which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits, but since the list does not include "VRPL" directly and considering the capacity constraint is also a key factor, the closest match is "CVRP" (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem), given the primary focus on capacity and absence of other specific features like backhauls or time windows.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 25
Description: A fleet of mobile electric vehicle charging trucks operates across a metropolitan area to service stranded EVs. Each truck (capacity <capacity> kWh) starts at a central depot (<loc_depot>) and visits stranded vehicles (<loc_customer>) requiring varying charge amounts (<demand>). Some locations also have portable chargers to collect (mixed backhauls). Time windows (<time_windows>) reflect driver availability and urgency (e.g., highway breakdowns). Routes must respect battery limits (<distance_limit> km) and trucks remain at their final location for next-day redeployment.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the trucks have a capacity limit (C), there are mixed backhauls (MB) as some locations also have portable chargers to collect, routes must respect battery limits which translates to distance limits for the vehicles (L), and time windows (TW) are present to reflect driver availability and urgency. Since this variant includes all these attributes: capacity, mixed backhaul, distance limit, and time window, the most specific and appropriate classification is VRPMBLTW.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 73
Description: A cloud service provider deploys modular servers (linehaul) to temporary data centers for tech conferences and retrieves them post-event (backhaul). Event venues require server installation by 6 PM the day before the event and return collection within 48 hours. The trucks must prioritize setup over teardown and cannot overload with both new and old equipment. Routes conclude at the final venue to minimize idle time.
Reason: The problem description includes specific time window constraints for the installation and retrieval of servers (setup by 6 PM the day before the event, and return collection within 48 hours). Additionally, it specifies that backhaul demand (return collection) can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand (installation) is met, indicating a backhaul requirement. There is no explicit mention of vehicle capacity or distance limits being a concern, and the routes conclude at the final venue, suggesting an open route. Therefore, the most fitting variant is VRPBTW, which accounts for backhaul and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 7
Description: A courier service handles urgent package deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) and return pickups (<demand_backhaul>). Clients specify strict delivery windows (<time_windows>) for time-sensitive items (e.g., medical samples or electronics), while return pickups must occur after deliveries. Each vehicle (<capacity> kg limit) starts at the hub (<loc_depot>), prioritizes deliveries, then collects returns from the same route without backtracking. The goal is to minimize delays and ensure all stops are serviced within their windows, ending routes at the final customer location.
Reason: The problem description specifies that there are both linehaul (urgent package deliveries) and backhaul (return pickups) demands, with the condition that return pickups must occur after deliveries, indicating a backhaul demand that can be satisfied only when all the linehaul demand is satisfied. Additionally, it mentions strict delivery windows for time-sensitive items, implying time window constraints. There is also a mention of a capacity limit for each vehicle. Given these specifics, the most appropriate variant is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Capacity, and Time Windows. The "O" (open route) is not applicable here since the vehicles start at the hub (depot) and do not necessarily end their routes there, but this does not imply an open route as defined in the options.

Description: An educational company delivers interactive science booths to schools and collects them after school hours. Each school has a delivery time window before classes begin and a pickup window after dismissal. Delivery vehicles (<capacity> capacity) must first drop off booths and then collect them later, ensuring the combined weight of booths and any returned materials stays within capacity limits. Routes must be planned to serve all schools within their schedules while minimizing travel distance.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each school has a delivery and pickup time window, which aligns with the "TW" (time window) attribute. Additionally, it mentions that the vehicles have a capacity limit for both delivering booths and collecting returned materials, which is indicative of the "C" (capacity) attribute. However, since the presence of time windows ("TW") takes precedence over the capacity constraint in classification, and there are no indications of open routes, backhaul demands, or distance limits, the most appropriate variant is VRPTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows).

Description: Wilderness firefighting crews need urgent supplies (water, tools) delivered (<demand_linehaul>) and damaged gear retrieved (<demand_backhaul>). Trucks (<capacity> kg) must first supply fire stations before pickups. Routes stay within <distance_limit> km to ensure rapid response, ending at the last serviced location.
Reason: The problem description mentions the need for delivering supplies (linehaul) and retrieving damaged gear (backhaul), with backhaul occurring only after linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there is a distance limit for the routes, which aligns with the "L" (distance limits) feature. The description does not mention any open routes or time window constraints, so these features ("O" and "TW") are not applicable. The presence of both linehaul and backhaul with a condition on their order and the distance limit best matches the VRPBL variant.

Description: An airport’s ground support team must deliver luggage carts, conveyor belts, and maintenance tools (linehaul) to aircraft gates for inbound flights. After flight operations, they retrieve used equipment (backhaul) for cleaning and redistribution. Each vehicle’s capacity (<capacity>) must accommodate both deliveries and pickups without overloading. Gates have time windows (<time_windows>) aligned with flight schedules, requiring precise arrival timing. Routes are restricted by distance limits (<distance_limit>) to ensure drivers complete shifts within regulated working hours. Backhauls must follow linehaul stops to avoid equipment shortages during flight turnarounds.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: the requirement for vehicles to handle both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) with a condition that backhauls follow linehaul stops, indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. There are also specific time windows for service at gates, and distance limits for routes. The presence of these features ("MB", "TW", "L") points towards a variant that accommodates mixed backhaul, time window constraints, and distance limits. Since there is no explicit mention of an open route (vehicles not returning to the depot), we do not include "O" in our classification.

Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 82
Description: A public health organization deploys mobile teams to administer vaccines and conduct health surveys in underserved neighborhoods. Each vehicle (<capacity> doses/supplies) starts at a medical hub (<loc_depot>), visiting pop-up locations (<loc_customer>) during strict time windows (<time_windows>) aligned with community availability. Teams both administer vaccines (linehaul) and collect completed health surveys (backhaul), with no precedence constraints between these activities. Vehicles remain at their final location for next-day operations.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each vehicle has a capacity for doses/supplies, operates within strict time windows, and performs both linehaul (administering vaccines) and backhaul (collecting health surveys) activities without precedence constraints. This matches the VRP variant with mixed backhaul and time window constraints. The "open route" aspect is not applicable since vehicles stay at their final location for next-day operations, implying they do not return to the depot but this does not fit the definition of an open route in traditional VRP variants. Thus, the most specific matching variant is VRPMBTW.

Description: A medical supply company distributes oxygen tanks to hospitals (linehaul) within critical time windows to prevent shortages. Empty cylinders are retrieved (backhaul) during scheduled maintenance periods after patient care concludes. Trucks must first fulfill all delivery obligations (B), ensuring capacity constraints (C) are respected. Routes finalize at the last pickup location (O), streamlining service without unnecessary depot trips.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks must first fulfill all delivery obligations (linehaul) before retrieving empty cylinders (backhaul), indicating a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. This aligns with the "B" attribute. Additionally, the critical time windows for deliveries and scheduled maintenance periods for pickups suggest that there are specific time window constraints ("TW"). The requirement for routes to finalize at the last pickup location without returning to the depot points towards an open route ("O"). Given these attributes, the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW, which covers backhaul, time windows, and open routes.

Description: Submersible teams depart from a coastal base (<loc_depot>) to underwater archaeological sites (<loc_customer>) to deliver diving gear and excavation tools (<demand_linehaul>). They later retrieve recovered artifacts (<demand_backhaul>). The submersibles have a limited cargo capacity of <capacity> liters and must complete their mission within <distance_limit> nautical miles of the base to avoid extended dives. Deliveries must occur first to ensure equipment is available for artifact recovery. Routes conclude at the deepest site, optimizing fuel use.
Reason: The problem description specifies that submersibles have a limited cargo capacity, which aligns with the 'C' (capacity) attribute. Additionally, there is a requirement for deliveries (linehaul) to be made before any retrieval (backhaul), indicating a 'B' (backhaul) feature where backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. The constraint on the mission's distance from the base points to an 'L' (distance limits) characteristic. Since the routes conclude at the deepest site and do not necessarily return to the depot, this suggests an 'O' (open route) aspect. However, given the presence of both 'B' and 'L', and the precedence of backhaul over linehaul, the most specific variant is VRPBL, as it covers capacity, backhaul, and distance limit constraints without the need for an open route or mixed backhaul.

Description: A pharmaceutical company delivers time-sensitive medications to pharmacies and nursing homes, while simultaneously retrieving empty pill bottles for recycling. Each vehicle carries a <capacity> kg payload, balancing delivery demands (<demand_linehaul>) and pickup quotas (<demand_backhaul>). Pharmacies have strict <time_window> windows for receiving perishable drugs, while bottle pickups must occur after the facility’s closing hours. Drivers must complete all deliveries before initiating pickups, ensuring compliance with health regulations and avoiding overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem description includes a capacity constraint, backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, and strict time window constraints for both deliveries and pickups. The scenario does not indicate open routes or distance limits for the vehicles. Therefore, the most specific variant that fits this description is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Capacity, and Time Windows.

Description: A catering company supplies cooking equipment (stoves, utensils, generators) to corporate event venues and later retrieves it. Deliveries must occur before pickups to ensure equipment readiness for events. Each truck has a capacity limit. Venues have setup time windows (before the event) and pickup deadlines afterward. The aim is to optimize routes for minimal distance, respecting capacity and time constraints, with vehicles ending their routes at the final pickup point.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each truck has a capacity limit, which corresponds to the "C" in CVRP. Additionally, it states that there are setup time windows before events and pickup deadlines afterward, indicating time window constraints, denoted by "TW". The open route condition is not explicitly mentioned, and backhaul (B) or mixed backhaul (MB) conditions are not applicable as the scenario only involves delivering and then picking up equipment, without the complexity of simultaneous or conditional demands. There is no mention of distance limits for vehicles, so "L" is not applicable. Therefore, the most fitting variant that captures the capacity and time window constraints is VRPTW.

Description: A space agency needs to transport fragile satellite components to remote desert launch pads. Each pad has a strict time window (<time_windows>) tied to orbital launch windows. Delivery trucks (<capacity> cubic meters) must navigate rugged terrain from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>), avoiding overloading while adhering to fuel constraints (<distance_limit> km). The components require temperature-controlled storage, limiting truck capacity. Routes must ensure all pads receive equipment precisely when needed, without exceeding distance or load limits.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks have a capacity limit, must adhere to distance (fuel) constraints, and each launch pad has a strict time window for deliveries. There is no mention of backhaul or open routes. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches this scenario is VRPLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits and Time Windows.

Amphibious vehicles (capacity <capacity>) launch from a coastal base (<loc_depot>), performing mixed tasks based on tidal conditions. Crews finish routes at the last pod to conduct on-site analysis.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: the vehicles have a capacity limit (capacity <capacity>), there are both delivery (installing new plants) and pickup (collecting water samples) tasks, and these tasks must be completed within specific tidal time windows. Additionally, the routes do not return to the depot, as crews finish at the last pod. The mixed backhaul feature is also present since the tasks of delivering and picking up can be performed simultaneously.

Components vary in size and weight (<demand>), and delivery trucks (<capacity> ton capacity) must not exceed their load limits. Once components arrive at the final pad in their route, trucks remain on-site to assist with installation, eliminating return trips to the depot. The challenge is to plan routes that respect strict time windows (e.g., clear skies or low wind periods) while ensuring no truck overloads and minimizing total travel distance.

The goal is to schedule routes ensuring all equipment arrives within time constraints, while preventing overloading and avoiding route distances beyond the vans’ operational limits.
Reason: The problem description includes capacity constraints for the delivery vans, distance limits due to steep mountain roads, and time window constraints for unloading at each retreat.

The challenge is to plan efficient routes that ensure all furniture is delivered and retrieved without overloading vehicles. The depot locations and customer sites are <locs>, with delivery demands <demand_linehaul> and pickup demands <demand_backhaul>.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks must deliver and then collect furniture, with the requirement that backhaul (pickup) demands can only be satisfied after all linehaul (delivery) demands are met. This matches the "B" (backhaul) characteristic. Additionally, there is a mention of truck capacity, which is a standard feature in VRP problems and is denoted by "C". However, since the presence of backhaul demand ("B") takes precedence over capacity ("C") in the classification, and no other specific constraints like distance limits, open routes, or time windows are mentioned, the most appropriate variant is VRPB.

Description: A scooter-sharing company redistributes electric scooters (linehaul) to high-demand zones (<loc_customer>) and collects damaged units (backhaul) for repair. Each delivery truck (<capacity> scooters) must first replenish busy areas before visiting repair depots to retrieve broken scooters. Routes must not exceed a <distance_limit> km limit to align with battery range and avoid overtime labor costs. The central hub (<loc_depot>) requires efficient planning to balance supply-and-demand while ensuring vehicles end their routes at the final collection point, never returning empty.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each truck has a capacity for scooters, must first deliver to high-demand areas (linehaul) before collecting damaged units (backhaul), and routes are subject to a distance limit. There is no mention of time window constraints or open routes where vehicles do not return to the depot. The need to satisfy linehaul demand before backhaul demand points towards a VRPB variant, but since there is also a distance limit, the more specific variant VRPBL is selected.

Construction trucks (<capacity>) depart from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>), ending routes at the final stop. Routes must ensure all parts arrive within time windows while adhering to payload limits, avoiding depot returns to optimize efficiency.
Reason: The problem description mentions a central warehouse (depot) and the need to deliver modular stage components to various venues within specific time windows. There is no mention of backhaul, open routes, or vehicle distance limits. The key constraints are capacity (of the construction trucks) and time windows (due to venue curfews). Since the variant must reflect these constraints, and the "C" for capacity is ignored when other features like time windows are present, the most appropriate variant is VRPTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows).

Routes are capped at <distance_limit> km to fit within driver shift durations, ending at the final stop. The objective is to streamline inventory flow while reducing logistics costs and excess mileage.
Reason: The problem specifies that delivery trucks must first restock stores (linehaul) before retrieving returns (backhaul), indicating a backhaul scenario. Additionally, it mentions a capacity constraint for the total load and a distance limit for the routes. Since there is no mention of open routes or time window constraints, the most fitting variant is VRPBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Distance Limits.

Description: A smart city operator deploys vehicles (capacity <capacity>) to empty waste bins (<demand_backhaul>) and repair IoT sensors (<demand_linehaul>) at locations (<locs>). Time windows (<time_windows>) reflect traffic avoidance policies (e.g., no collections during rush hour). Service times (<service_time>) vary for waste compaction vs. sensor calibration. Routes must dynamically interleave pickups and deliveries based on real-time fill-level alerts.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles with capacity constraints (C), backhaul demand for emptying waste bins that can be satisfied only after linehaul demand for repairing IoT sensors (B), and time window constraints to avoid traffic during rush hours (TW). The description also mentions mixed activities of pickups and deliveries, which aligns with the mixed backhaul feature (MB). However, since the backhaul demand is specified to occur only after all linehaul demand is met, we prioritize the B feature over MB. There is no mention of open routes or distance limits, so O and L are not included. Thus, the most appropriate variant is VRPBTW.

Routes must stay within a distance limit (<distance_limit>) to ensure timely service without returning to the depot. The challenge is to balance the weight of heavy equipment and compost while optimizing urban driving routes to minimize emissions and fuel use.
Reason: The problem description indicates the presence of both delivery (linehaul) and collection (backhaul) activities, with a requirement that deliveries are completed before collections. Additionally, there is a distance limit for the routes. No open route or time window constraints were specified. The capacity constraint is mentioned but it is standard in VRP problems and thus not a distinguishing feature here.

Deliveries must precede pickups to avoid overloading vehicles before unloading. Routes end at the final airport, streamlining logistics.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks have a payload capacity limit, there are distance limits for the routes, and backhaul demand can only be satisfied after linehaul demand. This means the "C", "L", and "B" attributes are present. The open route ("O") attribute is not applicable as the routes end at the final airport, indicating the vehicles do return to the depot or follow a defined endpoint. There is no mention of time window constraints, so "TW" is not included. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and Distance Limits.

Description: A music festival organizer needs to transport sound equipment between multiple stages and storage areas during a multi-day event. The main equipment warehouse is located at <loc_depot>, and each stage location <loc_customer> requires <demand> units of gear. Trucks have a maximum capacity of <capacity> units and a maximum round-trip distance of <distance_limit> km to avoid fuel shortages. Design routes to ensure all stages receive their equipment without exceeding vehicle limits or distance thresholds.
Reason: The problem description mentions that trucks have a maximum capacity and a maximum round-trip distance, which directly corresponds to the "C" (capacity) and "L" (distance limits) attributes. There is no mention of backhauls, mixed backhauls, or time windows, nor is there an indication that the routes are open (i.e., vehicles do not return to the depot). Therefore, the most fitting variant from the provided list is CVRPL, standing for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits.

Description: Technicians maintain IoT sensors across a city, where each sensor has a calibration time window (<time_windows>) dictated by data collection cycles. Vehicles (<capacity>) carry replacement parts (deliveries) and collect faulty units (pickups), with mixed sequencing allowed. Routes start at a service hub (<loc_depot>) and are constrained by battery range (<distance_limit>). Technicians remain at their last sensor location for next-day assignments.
Reason: The problem description mentions that vehicles have a distance limit due to battery range, and there are specific time windows for calibrating the IoT sensors. Additionally, the problem involves both delivering replacement parts (linehaul) and collecting faulty units (backhaul), with mixed sequencing allowed. Since the technicians remain at their last sensor location for next-day assignments, this implies an open route where the vehicles do not need to return to the depot. The most fitting variant from the list is VRPMBLTW, which includes mixed backhaul (MB), distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW).

Description: A sports event organizer rents out tents, chairs, and portable stages to venues for marathons, concerts, or festivals. The equipment must be delivered to event sites first, followed by pickups after the events conclude. Each truck (capacity <capacity>) departs from the storage facility (<loc_depot>), prioritizing timely deliveries. After all setups are complete, the trucks collect the rented gear, ensuring that backhaul operations do not interfere with event timelines. Drivers finish routes at the final pickup point, avoiding return trips to the depot to save costs and resources.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the trucks have a capacity constraint, which is indicated by the "C" in CVRP. Additionally, it specifies that after all setups are complete, the trucks collect the rented gear (indicating backhaul operations), and these operations must not interfere with event timelines, suggesting time window constraints ("TW"). The description also mentions that drivers finish routes at the final pickup point, avoiding return trips to the depot, which aligns with an open route variant ("O"). Given these details, the most fitting variant would be one that includes capacity, backhaul, and time window constraints, alongside being an open route, thus OVRPBTW is selected.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 78
Description: An arts organization deploys temporary sculptures and interactive exhibits (linehaul) to urban plazas for cultural festivals, then recovers materials post-event (backhaul). Each installation site has strict setup (<time_windows>) and teardown deadlines tied to event schedules. Heavy equipment (e.g., steel frameworks) and lightweight art pieces must be balanced against capacity limits (<capacity>). Trucks deliver all installations first, then collect materials, with routes concluding at the final recovery site to minimize equipment storage costs.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes that help in identifying the most specific variant. The arts organization is dealing with both linehaul (delivering installations) and backhaul (recovering materials) operations, which suggests a mixed backhaul scenario ("MB"). There are also strict setup and teardown deadlines, indicating time window constraints ("TW"). Additionally, there is a need to balance heavy and lightweight items against capacity limits, pointing towards a capacity constraint. Since the route concludes at the final recovery site and not necessarily returning to the original depot, it implies an open route ("O"). However, the "O" (open route) feature is less emphasized compared to the "MB" and "TW" features. Considering all these aspects, the most fitting variant is VRPMBTW, as it encompasses mixed backhaul, time windows, and capacity constraints.

Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 96
Description: A maritime logistics company supplies safety equipment and emergency kits to offshore oil platforms and retrieves hazardous waste fluids for disposal. Vehicles must first deliver linehaul items (safety gear) before collecting backhaul waste. Each vessel has a limited capacity, and routes are constrained by a maximum distance to avoid extended fuel shortages. The challenge is to design paths that reach all platforms efficiently while adhering to both capacity and distance limits.
Reason: The problem description mentions that vehicles must first deliver linehaul items (safety gear) before collecting backhaul waste, indicating a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after the linehaul. Additionally, each vessel has a limited capacity and routes are constrained by a maximum distance. There is no mention of open routes or time windows, so the most fitting variant is VRPBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Distance Limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMB, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 66
Description: During disaster recovery, a logistics team must deliver critical supplies (e.g., water, medical kits) to affected zones and collect hazardous waste (e.g., contaminated materials, debris) for disposal. Vehicles can prioritize either task first, but total cargo must stay within capacity limits. The challenge is to balance route efficiency with urgent service requirements.
Reason: The problem description involves delivering supplies (linehaul) and collecting hazardous waste (backhaul), with the need to balance these tasks while adhering to vehicle capacity limits. Since it is mentioned that vehicles can prioritize either task but there is no explicit mention of having to satisfy linehaul demands before backhaul, this indicates a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, the presence of urgent service requirements suggests the importance of time windows for delivery and collection. However, there is no indication of open routes or distance limits. Thus, the most fitting variant is VRPMBTW, which includes mixed backhaul and time window constraints.

Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 97
Description: A multi-stage marathon organizer needs to deliver medical supplies, water, and snacks to aid stations along the route. Each station has a time window for setup, and supplies vary in quantity (demand). Delivery trucks from the central warehouse (depot) must stay within distance limits to ensure punctuality, with routes concluding at the final aid station. Vehicles cannot exceed capacity limits, and routes must optimize delivery timing to align with runners’ expected arrival times.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each aid station has a time window for setup, and the delivery timing must be optimized to align with runners’ expected arrival times, which indicates time window constraints (TW). Additionally, it specifies that the delivery trucks have distance limits (L) and cannot exceed capacity limits (C), but since TW and L are more specific, they take precedence over C. The routes start from a central warehouse (depot) and conclude at the final aid station, implying a closed route rather than an open one, so "O" is not applicable. There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul, so "B" and "MB" are not relevant.

Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 22
Description: An educational institution urgently needs to deliver sealed exam packets to <num_customer> schools before their scheduled test times (<time_windows>). Each school (<loc_customer>) requires a specific number of packets (<demand>), and couriers must depart from the central exam hub (<loc_depot>) in vehicles holding up to <capacity> packets. Routes must avoid exceeding a <distance_limit> km limit to prevent delays, and couriers finish at their last delivery stop. The solution must balance speed, capacity, and strict time constraints to prevent exam disruptions.
Reason: The problem description includes a central depot from which couriers must depart, indicating a closed route. It also mentions that each school (customer) has specific demand, and there is a vehicle capacity limit, implying a capacity constraint. Additionally, the problem specifies strict time windows for deliveries to prevent exam disruptions, and a distance limit to avoid delays, meaning both time window and distance constraints are present. The scenario does not involve backhaul or mixed backhaul demands. Therefore, the most appropriate variant considering all these aspects is VRPLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits and Time Windows.

Description: A seafood distributor operates from a central hub (<loc_depot>) and supplies fresh catch to restaurants (<loc_customer>) with strict delivery time windows (<time_windows>) to ensure freshness. Simultaneously, trucks must collect expired or unsold seafood (<demand_backhaul>) from the same restaurants for disposal. Each truck has a refrigerated capacity (<capacity>), and routes must balance deliveries and pickups in any order while adhering to time-sensitive constraints. The goal is to minimize spoilage and fuel costs while meeting all time windows.
Reason: The problem description specifies several key attributes: (1) the need for trucks to have a refrigerated capacity, (2) the requirement to balance deliveries and pickups in any order, indicating mixed backhaul, (3) strict delivery time windows for ensuring freshness, and (4) the goal of minimizing costs while adhering to these constraints. Given these specifics, the variant that best matches is VRPMBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Limited Distance, and Time Windows. This variant captures all the described features including the mixed nature of the demand (deliveries and pickups), the presence of time window constraints, and implies capacity constraints for the vehicles.

Description: A school district needs to distribute science lab kits to schools for seasonal science fairs and collect them afterward. Each school has a time window for delivery setup and a separate window for post-event returns. Delivery trucks must first deliver the kits (linehaul) before returning to collect the used equipment (backhaul). Each truck has a capacity limit for both new and returned items. Routes must stay within a maximum distance to prevent driver exhaustion, ensuring all deliveries are completed before the fairs begin and pickups occur after the events conclude.
Reason: The problem description includes several key elements: the need for both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) operations, where pickups can only occur after deliveries (implying a backhaul that follows linehaul completion), each truck has capacity limits, there are time window constraints for both delivery and pickup, and there is a maximum travel distance to prevent driver exhaustion. The "O" (open route) feature is not applicable here since the trucks return to the depot. The presence of both linehaul and backhaul with specific timing and capacity constraints points towards a variant that supports mixed backhaul and time windows, but since the backhaul strictly happens after all linehauls, it aligns more closely with the VRPBLTW variant which covers backhaul, capacity, limited distance, and time windows.

Description: During a health crisis, mobile clinics are deployed to underserved regions. Medical equipment (tents, diagnostic kits, etc.) must be transported from a central medical hub (<loc_depot>) to temporary sites (<loc_customer>). Each site has a defined equipment demand (<demand>), and delivery trucks cannot exceed their payload capacity (<capacity>). Once the last clinic is stocked, drivers end their shift there to assist with setup. The challenge is to route trucks efficiently, ensuring all clinics are operational without exceeding vehicle limits.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each site (clinic) has a defined equipment demand, and delivery trucks cannot exceed their payload capacity. This directly points to a capacity constraint. Additionally, there is no mention of backhaul demands, distance limits for the vehicles, or specific time windows for deliveries. The requirement for drivers to end their shift at the last clinic they stock does not imply an open route as the context suggests a return to the depot is not necessary after the last delivery, but rather a stoppage of service. Therefore, the most fitting variant is the one that only considers capacity constraints, which is CVRP.

Description: A healthcare logistics firm redistributes MRI and CT scanners (linehaul) to hospitals while collecting biohazard-contaminated waste (backhaul) from imaging labs. Hospitals demand equipment within specific operational hours to avoid downtime, and waste must be retrieved within 4 hours of generation. Vehicles are restricted to a 250km route to ensure waste freshness and have dual capacity limits for medical gear and hazardous materials. Routes terminate at the last hospital without depot return.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (redistributing MRI and CT scanners) and backhaul (collecting biohazard-contaminated waste) operations, indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. There are also strict time window constraints for delivering equipment and collecting waste, as well as a distance limit of 250km for the vehicles. Additionally, the routes do not return to the depot, which points to an open route variant. The capacity for both medical gear and hazardous materials is managed, but this is implied in more specific variants like MB. Therefore, the most appropriate variant that encompasses all these characteristics is OVRPMBLTW.

This fits the definition of a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), especially considering it's a variant that includes both delivery and collection tasks, known as a VRP with backhauls. It does not fit the Scheduling Problem (SP) category as there is no mention of jobs, operations, or machines, and the primary concern is not about time scheduling but rather about optimizing routes and loads.',

Description: A chemical logistics company must deliver hazardous materials to industrial facilities (linehaul) and retrieve used containers for recycling (backhaul). Each delivery must occur within the client’s operational hours (TW), while pickups align with environmental regulations. Vehicles have strict capacity limits (C) to avoid overloading. Routes must stay within a daily distance limit (L) to comply with safety protocols. Starting from the depot, drivers first deliver chemicals, then collect waste containers, ending the route at the depot for proper disposal—ensuring no unnecessary return trips beyond the final task.
Reason: The problem description specifies that vehicles have strict capacity limits (C), must comply with a daily distance limit (L), and each delivery must occur within the client's operational hours (TW). Additionally, it is noted that backhaul (B) can only happen after all linehaul deliveries are completed. The routes start and end at the depot, which means this is not an open route (O). The variant 'VRPBLTW' best matches these criteria, as it includes capacity constraints, backhaul that follows linehaul, distance limits, and time windows for service.

Description: A health NGO operates mobile clinics to administer vaccines (deliveries) and conduct health surveys (pickups of completed forms) in underserved neighborhoods. Vehicles start at a storage hub (<loc_depot>) with cold-chain capacity (<capacity>). Clinics at (<loc_customer>) have strict operating hours (<time_windows>). Teams can interleave vaccine delivery and survey collection, ending shifts at the final location. The goal is to maximize coverage while respecting vehicle capacity and clinic time constraints.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles with a specific capacity (cold-chain capacity for vaccines), strict time windows for the clinics, and the need to maximize coverage while respecting these constraints. The scenario does not specify that the routes are open (vehicles do not return to the depot) or that there are distance limits on the vehicles. Additionally, the tasks of delivering vaccines and collecting surveys can be seen as linehaul and backhaul operations, respectively, but the description implies they can be interleaved, suggesting mixed backhaul. However, the primary distinguishing factors here are the capacity and time window constraints, making VRPTW the most appropriate variant. The mixed backhaul is a secondary feature that, in this context, doesn't change the primary classification due to the overarching constraints.

Trucks with <capacity> payloads leave the studio lot (<loc_depot>), optimize mixed-load routes, and terminate at the final location. Distance limits (<distance_limit> km) prevent crew overtime and reduce fuel costs.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks have a capacity limit, transport filming equipment to shooting locations (linehaul), and collect reusable props from wrap sites (backhaul). Additionally, there are distance limits to prevent crew overtime and reduce fuel costs. The backhaul demand is collected after the linehaul demand is satisfied, and the routes do not necessarily return to the depot, as they terminate at the final location. Therefore, the most specific variant that fits this description is 'OVRPBL', which includes open routes, backhaul, and distance limits.

Description: A sports league needs to deliver equipment (e.g., balls, uniforms, scoreboards) to stadiums across a region. Each truck can carry up to <capacity> units of equipment. Stadiums enforce strict time windows (<time_windows>) for deliveries to avoid disrupting pre-game preparations. Routes must also respect a daily distance limit (<distance_limit>), as drivers must service multiple venues without exceeding legal driving hours. Optimal routing ensures all gear arrives on time while minimizing fuel costs.
Reason: The problem description includes specific constraints such as a capacity limit for the trucks, strict time windows for deliveries, and a daily distance limit. These constraints directly match with the attributes "C" (capacity), "L" (distance limits), and "TW" (time window constraints) in the provided list of variants. Since "B" (backhaul demand) and "O" (open route) are not mentioned, the most fitting variant is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Capacity, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.

Description: A global art logistics firm must deliver fragile sculptures and paintings to museums across a region for a timed exhibition. Museums have narrow time windows (TW) when curators are available to install artworks. Trucks have strict capacity limits (C) to prevent damage, and routes must not exceed daily distance thresholds (L) to comply with driver working-hour regulations. The solution must balance speed, safety, and precision to ensure all pieces arrive undamaged and on schedule.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks have strict capacity limits (C), routes must not exceed daily distance thresholds (L), and there are narrow time windows (TW) for delivery. There is no mention of backhaul demand, mixed backhaul, or open routes, which means we do not need to include B, MB, or O in the variant.

Routes must remain under <distance_limit> km to ensure vehicles can operate without refueling. The firm prioritizes minimizing travel costs and environmental impact, with drivers ending their routes at the last data center visited.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the trucks have a capacity limit for the equipment they can carry, which corresponds to the "C" in CVRP. Additionally, it mentions that each truck must sequence deliveries (linehaul) before pickups (backhaul), indicating a backhaul requirement where backhaul can only be satisfied after linehaul, fitting the "B" attribute. The need to keep routes under a certain distance limit without refueling matches the "L" attribute. There is no mention of time windows for service or the need for open routes (vehicles not returning to the depot).

Description: A medical gas supplier delivers full oxygen or nitrogen cylinders to hospitals and clinics while collecting empty cylinders for refilling. Each truck must deliver all required cylinders to healthcare facilities first, then pick up empties on the return trip to the depot. The vehicle capacity <capacity> must account for both outbound (full cylinders) and inbound (empty cylinders) loads. With <locs> indicating the depot and 20 healthcare sites, the delivery demand <demand_linehaul> and pickup demand <demand_backhaul> must be balanced to avoid overloading trucks. The goal is to optimize routes for timely service while adhering to strict capacity constraints.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the truck must first deliver all required (full) cylinders to healthcare facilities and then pick up empty cylinders on the return trip. This implies a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after the linehaul (outbound) demand is met, fitting the "B" criteria. Additionally, there are strict capacity constraints for both outbound and inbound loads, which aligns with the "C" designation. Since there is no mention of open routes, distance limits, or time window constraints, the most appropriate variant is CVRPB.

Only after all deliveries are completed can the truck collect cores (<demand_backhaul> kg) from the same or other locations. The vehicle’s capacity (<capacity> kg) must handle both outbound parts and inbound cores without overloading. Routes end at the last core pickup location to minimize empty driving.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicle must first complete all deliveries (linehaul) before it can start collecting cores (backhaul). This directly corresponds to the "B" attribute, signifying backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand. Additionally, there is a mention of the vehicle’s capacity being limited for both outbound and inbound loads, which aligns with the "C" (capacity) attribute. Since no other attributes such as distance limits, open routes, or time windows are specifically mentioned, the most fitting variant is VRPB.

Vehicles are subject to capacity and distance limits to ensure timely operations. The aim is to minimize travel distance while ensuring all deployments and pickups are completed on schedule, with routes ending at the final recycling pickup location.
Reason: The problem description specifies that there are time windows for installation crews, indicating "TW". It also mentions that vehicles have capacity and distance limits, which corresponds to "C" and "L". However, since "C" is ignored when other features like "L" and "TW" are present, it is not included in the final variant.

Description: A utility company deploys new smart meters to residential neighborhoods while collecting outdated meters for recycling. Technicians must first deliver new meters (linehaul) within homeowners’ scheduled time windows, then return to retrieve the old units (backhaul). Each van’s capacity restricts the number of meters it can carry. Routes are capped at a distance limit to ensure timely service, with all installations finalized before the next billing cycle and pickups completed within a week.
Reason: The problem description indicates that technicians must deliver new meters (linehaul) and then return to pick up old meters (backhaul), which aligns with the "MB" (mixed backhaul) characteristic. Additionally, there are time windows for deliveries, which corresponds to the "TW" (time window constraints) feature. The capacity of each van and the distance limit for routes also suggest the presence of "C" (capacity) and "L" (distance limits).

After customers finish their rentals, the boats are collected and returned to the depot. Deliveries must be completed before pickups to ensure availability for renters, and the truck’s capacity (<capacity>) must handle both outgoing rentals and incoming returns. Routes terminate at the last pickup location, eliminating redundant travel and reducing operational costs.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the truck’s capacity must handle both outgoing rentals and incoming returns, which indicates a mixed backhaul scenario (MB). Additionally, it is specified that deliveries must be completed before pickups, implying time window constraints (TW) for the service. There is no mention of open routes (O), so the route is assumed to be closed, returning to the depot. The distance limits (L) are not explicitly mentioned, but the focus on reducing operational costs and eliminating redundant travel suggests optimizing routes within some implicit limit. However, without explicit mention, we do not assume (L). Thus, the most fitting variant is VRPMBTW.

Description: A tech firm deploys new laptops and servers (linehaul) to client offices (<loc_customer>) during business hours (<time_windows>). Simultaneously, it collects outdated electronics (backhaul) for recycling. Offices mandate strict time windows for service to align with staff availability. Vehicles (<capacity>) begin at the central tech hub (<loc_depot>), ensure deliveries occur before pickups, and terminate routes at the final collection point. The goal is to optimize routes while respecting capacity limits and minimizing downtime for clients.
Reason: The problem description specifies several key attributes: the presence of both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) operations, strict time windows for service at client offices, and the need to optimize routes while respecting vehicle capacity. However, since deliveries must occur before pickups, this indicates a "backhaul" condition rather than a "mixed backhaul" scenario. The requirement for strict time windows aligns with the "TW" attribute. There is no mention of open routes or distance limits for vehicles, so "O" and "L" do not apply. Given these conditions, VRPBTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls and Time Windows) is the most appropriate variant.

Description: A movie production company manages mobile catering and equipment transport for <num_customer> simultaneous film sets (<loc_customer>) across a region. Refrigerated trucks depart from a central kitchen (<loc_depot>) with meals (<demand_linehaul>) and empty containers (<capacity>). They swap out camera gear between locations (<demand_backhaul>) while delivering food in any order. Due to perishability constraints, each route cannot exceed <distance_limit> km. After the final set service, trucks park at that location for next-day operations. The challenge is to keep crews fed and equipped while minimizing cross-set travel interference.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: the trucks have a distance limit (<distance_limit>), there is a backhaul demand (swapping out camera gear) that can only be satisfied after the linehaul demand (delivering meals) is met, and the routes are open as the trucks do not return to the depot but instead park at the last service location. These characteristics point towards a Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Open Routes (OVRPBL).

Description: An environmental agency maps city trees (<loc_customer>) from a nursery (<loc_depot>) using trucks (<capacity>).  
Teams deliver saplings (<demand_linehaul>) while collecting invasive plant seeds (<demand_backhaul>) in flexible sequences.  
Each route must finish within <distance_limit> km to ensure daily data uploads.  
Vehicles remain in assigned districts overnight after final assessments.
Reason: The problem description mentions that teams deliver saplings (linehaul demand) and collect invasive plant seeds (backhaul demand) in flexible sequences, which suggests a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, there is a distance limit for each route, indicating the presence of 'L' (distance limits). There are no explicit time window constraints or open routes mentioned, so 'TW' and 'O' are not applicable. The capacity aspect is implied by the use of trucks but is not the primary differentiator among the options given the other more specific constraints.

Description: A city parks department dispatches crews from a nursery (<loc_depot>) to plant young trees (<demand_linehaul>) and remove invasive species (<demand_backhaul>) across parks and streets (<loc_customer>). Trucks have a <capacity> limit for carrying saplings and debris. Crews can alternate planting and removal tasks in any sequence, finishing their route at the final job site. The goal is to minimize travel distance while ensuring all locations are serviced.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the trucks have a capacity limit, and there are both planting (linehaul) and removal (backhaul) tasks. Importantly, it is mentioned that crews can alternate between planting and removal tasks in any sequence, which suggests that linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, pointing towards a mixed backhaul scenario. There is no explicit mention of distance limits for the vehicles, time window constraints, or the requirement for routes to be open, thus excluding the "L", "TW", and "O" attributes. Given these conditions, the most appropriate variant is VRPMB, as it includes the capacity constraint ("C" - though noted to be ignored when other features like "MB" are present) and the mixed backhaul feature.

Description: A research team coordinates field operations where trucks depart from a base camp (<loc_depot>) to deliver excavation tools (<demand_linehaul>) to dig sites (<loc_customer>) and retrieve artifacts/soil samples (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have fragile-item weight limits (<capacity>) and must stay within a fuel-efficient range (<distance_limit>) due to remote terrain. Routes terminate at the last site to reduce environmental impact. Optimizing mixed sequences (e.g., delivering shovels before collecting pottery shards) is critical.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks have to deliver excavation tools (linehaul demand) and also retrieve artifacts/soil samples (backhaul demand), with the backhaul demand being satisfied only after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, vehicles have a fragile-item weight limit (capacity) and must stay within a fuel-efficient range (distance limit). The routes terminate at the last site, implying an open route where the vehicles do not return to the depot. There's no mention of time window constraints.

Description: An environmental agency maintains a network of air quality sensors across metropolitan areas. Service vehicles depart from the lab (<loc_depot>) carrying calibration equipment (<demand_linehaul>) and empty storage drives (<capacity>), visiting sensor nodes (<loc_customer>) to perform maintenance while collecting pollution data (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have strict range limits (<distance_limit>) due to electric battery constraints. The optimal routing must allow technicians to service sensors in any order, combining calibration and data collection tasks efficiently without exceeding vehicle capacities or range limitations.
Reason: The problem description indicates that vehicles have a strict range limit (distance_limit), which corresponds to the "L" attribute. Additionally, there is a need for carrying calibration equipment (linehaul) and collecting pollution data (backhaul), with no indication that backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. This suggests a mixed backhaul scenario, indicated by "MB". Since there is no mention of open routes or time window constraints, the most appropriate variant is VRPMBL, which includes mixed backhaul ("MB") and distance limits ("L").

Description: A furniture rental company manages a fleet of trucks (capacity <capacity>) to deliver rented items (sofas, tables) to customers (<loc_customer>) and pick up expired rentals from others. Each stop has a time window (<time_windows>) for service (e.g., when residents are home). Deliveries and pickups are mixed, and trucks conclude routes after the last job. The goal is to minimize travel distance while respecting capacity and time constraints.
Reason: The problem involves a capacity constraint (C), mixed backhaul (deliveries and pickups are mixed, MB), and time window constraints (TW) for each service stop. The trucks have a capacity limit, they handle both deliveries and pickups without the need to satisfy one type of demand before the other, and each stop has a specific time window during which the service must be provided. There is no mention of open routes (O) or vehicle distance limits (L).

Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile clinics to administer vaccines (<demand_linehaul>) in rural villages (<loc_customer>) while collecting patient health records (<demand_backhaul>) for central processing. Vans with <capacity> storage start at a regional hospital (<loc_depot>), mix delivery/pickup tasks dynamically, and conclude routes at the final village. Routes are capped at <distance_limit> km to ensure staff can complete shifts safely.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the vans have a distance limit, indicating the "L" attribute. It also mentions both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) tasks, but these can be mixed dynamically, which fits the "MB" (mixed backhaul) attribute. Since there is no mention of time windows for service or the requirement for open routes, the most specific variant that matches the provided details is VRPMBL.

Description: A company specializing in temporary event setups must deliver modular stages, lighting rigs, and crowd-control barriers to festivals and corporate events, then dismantle and collect the equipment afterward. Vehicles can interleave deliveries and pickups in any order to maximize route efficiency. Each truck has a capacity of <capacity>, requiring careful planning to avoid overloading. The goal is to minimize travel distance and ensure all equipment is returned to the central warehouse after events conclude.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles must return to a central warehouse after completing their deliveries and pickups, which rules out the "O" (open route) variants. It also specifies that each truck has a capacity limit, requiring careful planning to avoid overloading, indicating the presence of a capacity constraint. There is no mention of time windows ("TW") or distance limits for the vehicles ("L"). The need to deliver and then collect equipment (linehaul and backhaul) suggests a mixed backhaul scenario, but the specific condition that backhaul demand can only be satisfied once all linehaul demands are met points more directly towards a "B" (backhaul) feature. However, given the flexibility in interleaving deliveries and pickups, and the primary focus on capacity and minimizing travel distance without explicit restrictions on backhauling until all deliveries are completed, the most fitting variant is CVRP, where the main constraints are the vehicle capacities and the requirement to minimize the total travel distance.

Description: An aviation maintenance provider supplies replacement parts to airports for aircraft repairs (linehaul) and collects defective components (backhaul) for analysis. Trucks start from a central depot and conclude routes at the final airport, avoiding return journeys. Each vehicle’s capacity (C) must accommodate both new parts and returned items. Distance limits (L) ensure operational efficiency in remote regions, preventing fuel shortages or extended delays.
Reason: The problem description specifies that trucks start from a central depot and conclude routes at the final airport, avoiding return journeys (O), each vehicle’s capacity must accommodate both new parts and returned items indicating mixed backhaul (MB), and there are distance limits (L) to ensure operational efficiency. There is no mention of time window constraints (TW). Therefore, the most fitting variant is OVRPMBL.

Description: Farmers across the region need fertilizers and seeds delivered to their fields (linehaul) while also requiring harvested crops to be collected (backhaul). Trucks depart from the central agro-supply depot (<loc_depot>) and must first deliver supplies to farms (<loc_customer>) before proceeding to collect crops from other farms. Each truck has a maximum load capacity of <capacity> kg, ensuring neither delivery nor pickup loads exceed this limit. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius to avoid overextending drivers, ending at the final stop without returning to the depot. The goal is to minimize total travel distance while efficiently managing both delivery and collection tasks.
Reason: The problem description indicates that trucks have a maximum load capacity, must manage both delivery (linehaul) and collection (backhaul) tasks without the need to return to the depot after their final stop, and are subject to a distance limit. The requirement for handling both linehaul and backhaul simultaneously without prioritizing one over the other until all deliveries are made suggests a mixed backhaul scenario. Since there is no mention of time window constraints, and the routes do not return to the starting depot, the most suitable variant from the list is OVRPMBL, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Load limits.

Description: A botanical garden is preparing for an international exhibition and needs to deliver <num_customer> rare tropical plants (<loc_customer>) to its venue. Each plant has a time window (<time_windows>) specifying when it must arrive to avoid wilting, and a service time (<service_time>) for climate-controlled unloading. Transport vans (<capacity>) are temperature-regulated but have limited space for plant containers. Routes must stay within a distance limit (<distance_limit>) to prevent overheating during transit. The objective is to plan routes that meet all time constraints while maximizing plant survival rates and minimizing fuel costs.
Reason: The problem description includes several key elements that align with a specific variant of the VRP. The presence of time windows for when each plant must arrive, service times for unloading, and distance limits to prevent overheating during transit are all crucial. The objective also involves capacity constraints due to the limited space in the transport vans. Given these factors, the most appropriate variant is VRPBLTW. This variant accounts for vehicle capacity (C), although it is not explicitly needed when other features like B, L, or TW are present, backhaul demand (B) is not applicable here, but the problem does include distance limits (L) and time window constraints (TW).

Description: A rescue team deploys emergency kits, medical supplies, and climbing gear to remote mountain shelters (linehaul) and later retrieves used equipment for maintenance. The vehicles must deliver critical supplies first, then collect returned gear. Each vehicle has a capacity limit, and routes must stay within a distance threshold to ensure rescuers can return safely without refueling. The goal is to service all shelters while minimizing total travel distance and respecting operational constraints.
Reason: The problem description indicates that vehicles must first deliver supplies (linehaul) and then collect used equipment (backhaul), with the condition that backhaul can only occur after linehaul is completed. Additionally, each vehicle has a capacity limit, and there are distance constraints to ensure safe return without refueling. No open routes or time windows were mentioned. Thus, the most fitting variant is VRPBL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Linehaul demands, where backhaul demand can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is met, and with distance limits.

Daily routes are capped at <distance_limit> km to ensure bee survival during transport. Technicians end routes at final hive locations for overnight monitoring.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles have a capacity limit for carrying replacement bee colonies and collecting honey, which implies 'C'. There is also a mention of backhaul demand (collecting honey) that can occur after servicing the hives, which aligns with 'B'. Additionally, the daily routes are capped at a distance limit, which matches 'L'. The technicians end their routes at final hive locations for overnight monitoring, suggesting an open route, which corresponds to 'O'. Since the problem includes capacity, backhaul, distance limits, and open routes, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.

Description: A solar energy company must deliver newly manufactured solar panels to remote rural communities (linehaul) and simultaneously collect used lithium-ion batteries from previous installations (backhaul). Each truck has a capacity of <capacity> kg, requiring careful balancing between the weight of panels and the volume of returned batteries. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius to ensure vehicles can return to the depot before depleting fuel, especially in rugged terrain. The goal is to optimize delivery efficiency while adhering to environmental regulations for battery disposal.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering solar panels) and backhaul (collecting used lithium-ion batteries) operations, which can be carried out simultaneously, fitting the "MB" mixed backhaul criteria. Additionally, there is a clear capacity constraint for the trucks, indicated by the need to balance between the weight of solar panels and the volume of returned batteries, matching the "C" criterion. Furthermore, the routes are limited by a distance to ensure vehicles can return to the depot before depleting fuel, corresponding to the "L" distance limit. There is no mention of open routes or time window constraints in the description, so these are not included. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches this scenario is VRPMBL, which accounts for mixed backhaul, capacity, and distance limits.

Routes end at the last boutique, reducing unnecessary travel. The goal is to minimize total distance while ensuring all samples are rotated efficiently.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the vehicles have limited space, indicating a capacity constraint. It also specifies that some boutiques return outdated samples (backhaul) while others receive new ones (linehaul), and these activities can be interleaved, which aligns with the mixed backhaul (MB) characteristic. The goal is to minimize total distance, but there are no explicit mentions of distance limits for the vehicles (L), time windows (TW), or open routes (O).

Delivery vehicles departing from a central medical supply depot (<loc_depot>) have limited capacity (<capacity>) to carry bulky or sensitive equipment. Additionally, each route must not exceed a maximum travel distance (<distance_limit>) to ensure fuel efficiency and timely deliveries. The goal is to plan routes that deliver equipment to all hospitals within their assigned time windows (<time_windows>), without overloading trucks or exceeding distance limits, ending each route at the final hospital served.
Reason: The problem description includes several key constraints: the delivery vehicles have limited capacity (C), there is a maximum travel distance for each route (L), and each hospital has a strict time window during which the equipment must arrive (TW). There is no mention of backhaul demands or the requirement for open routes, meaning the vehicles must return to the depot.

Delivery trucks face *capacity (C)* limits due to the fragile nature of items and must adhere to *distance limits (L)* to ensure drivers comply with labor regulations. Routes must balance speed and safety while avoiding overloading vehicles or exceeding daily driving ranges.
Reason: The problem description mentions specific constraints including capacity (C), distance limits (L) for vehicles, and time windows (TW) for deliveries. There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, nor any indication that the routes are open (vehicles do not return to the depot).

The challenge is to coordinate routes that deliver all gear on time, respect capacity limits, and stay within distance constraints to ensure smooth transitions between cities.
Reason: The problem description mentions specific constraints including cargo capacity (C), daily distance limit (L), and strict setup time windows (TW) at each venue.

Equipment must be delivered to active gates (linehaul) as flights arrive (time windows) and collected from idle terminals (backhaul) once aircraft depart. Each van (capacity <capacity>) starts at the equipment depot (<loc_depot>), prioritizing delivery to gates with imminent arrivals before retrieving unused gear. Routes end at the farthest collection point, avoiding unnecessary returns. The challenge is synchronizing with flight schedules to prevent delays, while ensuring no vehicle exceeds its load capacity during mixed deliveries and pickups.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the vehicles (vans) have a capacity constraint, and there are both linehaul (delivering to active gates) and backhaul (collecting from idle terminals) demands. The backhaul can only be satisfied after the linehaul, which aligns with the "B" variant. Additionally, the timing of deliveries and pickups must synchronize with flight schedules, indicating time window constraints ("TW").

Routes end at the final removal site, avoiding return trips to the depot. Time windows enforce timely setup and teardown, and service times include assembly/disassembly of structures.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: backhaul (materials must be retrieved for reuse), open routes (routes end at the final removal site, not returning to the depot), and time window constraints (strict installation and retrieval time windows). There is no mention of vehicle capacity or distance limits being a concern.

Delivery trucks (<capacity>) must adhere to tight time windows (<time_windows>) to preserve nutrient freshness and avoid spoilage. Routes are constrained by <distance_limit> to prioritize local farms, and vehicles end their routes at the last farm to streamline waste collection.
Reason: The problem description includes the need for delivering perishable nutrients (linehaul) and collecting organic waste (backhaul), with the condition that delivery trucks must adhere to tight time windows, and routes are constrained by a distance limit. The description also mentions that vehicles end their routes at the last farm, indicating an open route.

The vehicles have a strict capacity (<capacity>) to handle both outbound and inbound loads. Routes must ensure deliveries precede pickups, with drivers ending their shift at the final collection point without returning to base.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: capacity constraints, backhaul demands that can only be satisfied after linehaul (delivering new servers), and time window constraints for the maintenance windows.

Reason: The problem description mentions that the vehicles need to deliver fresh produce (linehaul) and retrieve empty crates (backhaul). It is specified that both drop-offs and pickups can be interleaved, which suggests a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, the problem involves minimizing total distance with respect to vehicle capacity constraints, but does not explicitly mention time windows or open routes. Therefore, the most fitting variant from the provided list is VRPMB, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul.

Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 70
Description: A tech logistics firm delivers new computers, servers, and peripherals to corporate clients (linehaul) while also retrieving outdated or defective equipment for recycling (backhaul). Each delivery truck must first complete all its assigned deliveries before proceeding to collect returned devices to ensure capacity isn’t exceeded. Starting from the central warehouse (<loc_depot>), the route must prioritize delivering the required equipment (<demand_linehaul>) to offices (<loc_customer>) without overloading the vehicle (<capacity>). After the final delivery, the truck proceeds to collect returned devices (<demand_backhaul>) from other clients, ending its route at the last pickup location. The goal is to minimize total travel distance while adhering to capacity constraints and ensuring deliveries precede pickups.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks must first complete all deliveries (linehaul) before proceeding to collect returned devices (backhaul), which aligns with the "B" backhaul constraint. There is also a mention of capacity constraints, but since the backhaul requirement is more specific, it takes precedence over the general capacity ("C") classification. The problem does not mention distance limits for vehicles ("L"), open routes ("O"), mixed backhaul ("MB"), or time windows ("TW"). Thus, the most appropriate variant is VRPB, which specifically deals with backhaul demands following linehaul demands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 32
Description: Security companies distribute barriers, cameras, and emergency kits to multiple concert venues for a city-wide festival. Each venue specifies equipment requirements (<demand>), and trucks must respect weight limits (C). Vehicles begin at a central security depot (<loc_depot>) but terminate at their last stop (O). Routes are constrained by distance limits (L) to ensure personnel can finish setup before event start times. Concert organizers enforce strict time windows (TW) to align with venue access hours, requiring deliveries to arrive precisely before gates open.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes: each venue specifies equipment requirements (demand), trucks must respect weight limits (capacity, C), routes are constrained by distance limits (L), and there are strict time windows (TW) for deliveries. Additionally, the vehicles do not return to the depot after their last stop, indicating an open route (O). Since the problem involves all these elements (C, L, TW, and O), and given that the presence of other features (L, TW, O) makes the capacity constraint less specific, the most appropriate variant is VRPBLTW, but with the open route condition, it becomes OVRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 76
Description: A tech rental company supplies laptops, projectors, and AV equipment to corporate clients for conferences and events. Deliveries must be made before the event start times (linehaul with time windows), and equipment must be collected afterward (backhaul). Each truck’s capacity restricts the number of devices it can carry. Time windows are critical to ensure setups are completed before client deadlines and pickups occur after events end without delays.
Reason: The problem description specifies that deliveries (linehaul) must be made before event start times and pickups (backhaul) must occur after events, with both activities having time window constraints. It also mentions that each truck has a capacity limit for the number of devices it can carry. Since the solution requires handling both linehaul and backhaul demands within specific time windows and considering the vehicle capacities, the variant VRPMBTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows) is the most appropriate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 62
Description: A textbook publisher must deliver new editions (<demand> books per school) to rural schools (<loc_customer>) before the start of the academic year. Trucks (<capacity> tons) depart from a central depot (<loc_depot>), but road conditions limit route distances (<distance_limit>). Schools have strict delivery deadlines (<time_windows>) tied to teacher training schedules. The solution must ensure all textbooks arrive on time without exceeding truck capacities or route lengths, while minimizing total mileage.
Reason: The problem description mentions specific capacities for the trucks, distance limits due to road conditions, and strict delivery deadlines (time windows) for the schools. There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, nor any indication that the routes are open (i.e., vehicles do not return to the depot). Therefore, the most appropriate variant considering capacity, distance limits, and time windows is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPL, Predicted: VRPL, Index: 68
Description: Meteorologists deploy weather balloons from a central observatory (<loc_depot>) to monitor atmospheric conditions at high-altitude locations. Each truck carries instruments and helium tanks totaling up to <capacity> kg and must stay within a driving distance of <distance_limit> km to ensure they can reach launch sites without running out of fuel. After delivering equipment to the furthest mountain peak (<loc_customer>), the truck remains there to collect data, optimizing routes to cover all sites within the distance limit while avoiding overloading.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each truck has a capacity limit and must stay within a driving distance of <distance_limit> km. There is no mention of the trucks having to return to the depot, implying an open route. However, since the key constraints are capacity and distance limits, and there are no specific time windows or backhaul demands, the most fitting variant is VRPL which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 61
Description: A furniture rental company services urban clients (<loc_customer>) from a warehouse (<loc_depot>) using trucks with weight limits (<capacity>). Each stop may involve delivering new items (linehaul) or retrieving returned furniture (backhaul), sequenced flexibly. Clients specify installation/removal time slots (<time_windows>), and routes are constrained by a daily driving limit (<distance_limit>) to comply with labor regulations. Trucks remain at the final job site for overnight parking.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key attributes: capacity constraints (indicated by weight limits), backhaul and linehaul operations (suggesting mixed backhaul as both can be satisfied flexibly), time windows for service, and a daily driving limit (distance limit). The fact that trucks remain at the final job site for overnight parking indicates an open route. Given these factors, the most specific variant that matches all described attributes is VRPMBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows, and also implies an open route due to the "O" attribute being implied by the final location of the vehicles.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 38
Description: Airport ground crews must deploy baggage carts and service equipment to aircraft gates before flight operations begin and retrieve them afterward. Each gate has a delivery time window (during pre-flight setup) and a retrieval window (post-flight). Equipment deliveries (linehaul) must occur first, followed by pickups (backhaul), ensuring vehicles do not overload with both outgoing and returned gear. Routes finish at the last retrieval location to streamline operations.
Reason: The problem description mentions that equipment deliveries (linehaul) must occur first, followed by pickups (backhaul), indicating a backhaul demand that can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands. Additionally, there are specific delivery and retrieval time windows for each gate, which aligns with the "TW" (time window) constraint. There is no mention of distance limits or open routes, so we do not include "L" or "O". The capacity constraint is implied but not the primary focus given the presence of more specific constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPTW, Index: 60
Description: A mobile dental service visits schools and community centers (<loc_customer>) to provide check-ups and collect used equipment for sterilization. Each location has a specific time window (<time_windows>) for visits due to scheduling constraints. Vehicles start at a central clinic (<loc_depot>) with portable dental chairs (<capacity>), deliver clean equipment, and collect used tools in any order. After the final stop, vehicles remain on-site for next-day operations without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem description includes a central clinic (depot) from which vehicles start, and these vehicles do not return to the depot after their final stop, indicating an "open" route. Additionally, there are specific time windows for visiting each location, and the capacity of the vehicles is mentioned in terms of delivering clean equipment and collecting used tools. Since "O" (open routes) and "TW" (time window constraints) are specifically mentioned, and there is no indication of distance limits or backhaul demands that can only be satisfied after linehaul, the most fitting variant is OVRPTW. The mixed backhaul aspect ("MB") could also apply given the dual purpose of delivery and collection, but it is more specifically covered by the presence of "O" and "TW".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 6
Description: A bakery must deliver freshly baked bread to <num_customer> retail stores daily. Each store requires a specific quantity (<demand> loaves) and mandates delivery before opening hours (time window <time_windows>). Delivery trucks can carry no more than <capacity> loaves at once and must complete all deliveries within an 8-hour shift, limiting their total route distance to <distance_limit> km. The goal is to minimize fuel costs while ensuring bread stays fresh and adheres to strict delivery schedules.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each delivery truck has a capacity limit, there are strict time windows for deliveries, and the trucks must adhere to a distance limit. The variant VRPBLTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Capacity, Distance Limit, and Time Windows) encompasses all these constraints, making it the most suitable choice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPL, Index: 56
Description: An electric utility services <num_customer> public charging stations (<loc_customer>) from a central depot (<loc_depot>). Service vehicles (<capacity> battery capacity) perform two tasks: delivering charged batteries (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting depleted ones (<demand_backhaul>). Stations can be visited in any order, but each route cannot exceed <distance_limit> km due to battery constraints in service vehicles. The goal is to minimize total distance while ensuring no vehicle is overloaded during swaps.
Reason: The problem description specifies that service vehicles have a distance limit, which aligns with the "L" (distance limits) attribute. Additionally, it mentions two types of demands: delivering charged batteries (linehaul) and collecting depleted ones (backhaul), but there is no explicit mention that backhaul demand can only be satisfied after linehaul demand, nor is there an indication that both can be satisfied simultaneously. Given these details, and since there is no mention of open routes or time windows, the most fitting variant is VRPL, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPTW, Index: 46
Description: A nonprofit operates mobile medical clinics serving migrant workers in seasonal labor camps. Each camp (<loc_customer>) specifies availability windows ([e_i, l_i]) when workers are present for health screenings. The clinic van (<capacity>) carries limited medical supplies and must complete all visits within a daily travel limit (<L>) to conserve fuel and staff energy. Routes originate from a central health hub (<loc_depot>), visit all assigned camps in sequence, and end at the final camp location without returning to base.
Reason: The problem description includes several key attributes that help in identifying the most specific variant. The mobile medical clinics have a limited capacity for medical supplies, indicating a "C" (capacity) constraint. However, this is overshadowed by more specific constraints: each camp has availability windows, which corresponds to "TW" (time window) constraints. Additionally, the clinic van must complete all visits within a daily travel limit, aligning with "L" (distance limit). Lastly, the routes start from a central health hub but do not return to it, pointing towards an "O" (open route) characteristic. Combining these elements, the most fitting variant is OVRPTW, as it encompasses the open route and time window constraints, while the distance limit and capacity are implicitly covered under the broader VRP category.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 29
Description: Specialized vehicles (capacity <capacity>) distribute saplings to urban greening projects (<demand_linehaul>) while removing invasive plants (<demand_backhaul>) from parks. Starting at a nursery (<loc_depot>), routes service <num_customer> sites (<loc_customer>) with mixed sequencing, constrained by <distance_limit> km to prevent plant stress. Vehicles remain at the last job site for next-day operations.
Reason: The problem involves specialized vehicles with a capacity constraint, servicing both linehaul (distributing saplings) and backhaul (removing invasive plants) demands. The sequencing is mixed, meaning the vehicle can handle both types of demands simultaneously, indicating an "MB" (mixed backhaul) feature. Additionally, there are distance limits (<distance_limit> km) to prevent plant stress, which aligns with the "L" (distance limit) attribute. There is no mention of strict time window constraints or the need for open routes, so "TW" and "O" are not applicable. Given these features, the most specific variant that matches the description is VRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 63
Description: A STEM education initiative operates mobile labs (<capacity>) that visit schools (<loc_customer>) within strict class-period time windows (<time_windows>). Vehicles transport lab equipment from a storage hub (<loc_depot>), deliver materials for experiments, and collect completed student projects simultaneously. Routes may interleave deliveries and pickups (e.g., drop off microscopes at School X → collect robots from School Y). Labs remain at the last school for next-day workshops.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the mobile labs have a capacity limit, there are strict time windows for visiting schools (class-period time windows), and the routes include both deliveries and pickups simultaneously. This indicates mixed backhaul (MB) and time window constraints (TW). The need to return to the storage hub is not explicitly negated, so we do not assume an open route (O). There is no mention of distance limits (L) for the vehicles, and the requirement for backhauls does not specify that they can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands, ruling out a pure backhaul (B) classification. Given these details, the most fitting variant is VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPL, Predicted: VRPL, Index: 97
Description: Autonomous lunar rovers are tasked with transporting building materials from a landing depot (<loc_depot>) to construction sites across the moon’s surface. Each rover has a limited cargo capacity (<capacity>) and can only travel a set distance (<distance_limit>) before needing to conserve energy. The rovers must deliver materials to all designated sites (<loc_customer>) exactly once, ending their routes at the final destination. Routes must balance material demands (<demand>) and rover constraints to avoid overloading and ensure all construction phases proceed on schedule.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each rover has a limited cargo capacity and a set distance limit before needing to conserve energy. Additionally, the rovers must deliver materials to all designated sites exactly once, which implies a closed route where the rovers return to the depot or finish at a final destination, but not necessarily an open route. There is no mention of time windows or backhaul demands. Therefore, the most specific variant that fits this scenario includes capacity (C) and distance limits (L). Since "C" is ignored when other features like "L" are present, we select the variant with just "L".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 2
Description: A renewable energy company installs solar panels (linehaul) and retrieves old panels for recycling (backhaul). Installations must occur within <time_window> to align with customer schedules, while recycling pickups follow environmental compliance deadlines. Trucks have a <capacity> kg limit for panel transport and cannot exceed <distance_limit> km to conserve fuel. Routes end at the final recycling pickup point to streamline logistics.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key constraints that align with specific variants. There is a capacity limit for the trucks, indicating 'C'. The company deals with both installing (linehaul) and retrieving (backhaul) solar panels, which suggests a mixed backhaul scenario, fitting the 'MB' criteria. A distance limit is imposed to conserve fuel, matching the 'L' feature. Time windows are crucial for both installations and pickups, making 'TW' relevant. Since the routes end at the final recycling pickup point, it implies an open route, corresponding to the 'O' attribute. Considering all these factors, the most appropriate variant is OVRPMBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 86
Description: A aerospace logistics firm delivers specialized rocket components (e.g., fuel tanks, instrumentation) to satellite launch sites (linehaul) from their warehouse (<loc_depot>). After the launch, they retrieve unused or returned components (backhaul) for reuse or repurposing. Deliveries must be completed before pickups to ensure components are available for launch preparations. Routes end at the final retrieval location, with vehicle capacities (<capacity>) carefully managed to avoid overloading during transport.
Reason: The problem description specifies that deliveries (linehaul) must be completed before pickups (backhaul), and the vehicle capacities are carefully managed, which aligns with the "B" (backhaul) and "C" (capacity) attributes. However, since capacity is always considered in conjunction with other attributes and does not add a specific variant on its own, and given the requirement that backhaul can only occur after linehaul, the most fitting variant is VRPB. There is no mention of open routes, distance limits, or time windows, so these features ("O", "L", "TW") are not included.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: CVRP, Predicted: VRPL, Index: 84
Description: A satellite communications firm must deliver sensitive electronic components (e.g., antennas, transceivers, and power systems) from its headquarters to remote tracking stations in deserts, high-altitude regions, and coastal areas. Each station requires specific parts, and the delivery vehicles have restricted cargo space due to fragile equipment. The goal is to design the most efficient routes to ensure all stations receive their components without overloading vehicles, while navigating challenging terrain and minimizing travel costs. The depot is located at the company’s central facility.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the delivery vehicles have restricted cargo space, indicating a capacity constraint (C). It also specifies the need to navigate challenging terrains and minimize travel costs, which could imply distance limits for the vehicles (L). However, since the presence of L implies that C is ignored in classification, we prioritize L. There is no mention of backhaul demand, open routes, or time window constraints, so VRPL (Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits) is the most appropriate variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 44
Description: A hydrogen fuel distributor services <num_customer> refueling stations (<loc_customer>) using cryogenic trucks with <capacity> kg H₂ capacity. Vehicles perform simultaneous deliveries of fresh hydrogen (<demand_linehaul>) and retrievals of empty cylinders (<demand_backhaul>), constrained by station operating hours (<time_windows>) and maximum route durations (<time_limit>) to maintain fuel pressure. Mixed sequences must account for varying fill/empty times (<service_time>) at each stop.
Reason: The problem description mentions several key attributes: there are both linehaul (deliveries of fresh hydrogen) and backhaul (retrievals of empty cylinders) demands, which can be satisfied simultaneously, indicating "MB". There are also time window constraints ("TW") due to station operating hours and maximum route durations. The capacity of the trucks is mentioned, but since we have other more specific features, the "C" designation is not the primary focus. There is no indication that the routes are open or that there are distance limits, so "O" and "L" do not apply.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: VRPTW, Index: 1
Description: A rental company supplies event venues with temporary equipment (e.g., chairs, stages) and collects them post-event. Each venue has a delivery time window (e.g., setup hours before the event) and a pickup window (e.g., 2–4 hours after the event ends). The trucks must deliver equipment first, then return to collect it, all while respecting the <capacity> ton limit. The challenge is to optimize routes to serve all venues efficiently without exceeding time windows or capacity limits.
Reason: The problem description mentions a capacity limit for the trucks, time windows for both delivery and pickup, and the need to deliver equipment first and then return to collect it. The requirement to return to the depot for collecting the equipment indicates that this is not an open route. There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands being satisfied only after linehaul demands are met, nor are there distance limits for the vehicles. Therefore, the most fitting variant is one that includes capacity and time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 47
Description: A scientific institute needs to replace outdated lab equipment across universities (<loc_customer>) by delivering new gear (linehaul) and collecting old machinery (backhaul). Each university has a service time (<service_time>) for calibration and a time window (<time_windows>) aligned with lab downtimes. Vehicles (<capacity>) must not exceed <distance_limit> to ensure timely swaps, and routes terminate at the final destination to avoid depot return logistics.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul (collecting old machinery), distance limits for vehicles, and time window constraints aligned with lab downtimes. It also specifies that the routes terminate at the final destination, indicating an open route. These features match the characteristics of OVRPMBLTW, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Linehaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 66
Description: A luxury watch brand must deliver high-value items to global exhibitions. Each boutique has a *time window (TW)* for delivery to coincide with grand openings. Transport vehicles are *capacity (C)* constrained by the need for secure, climate-controlled storage. Routes must stay within *distance limits (L)* to minimize transit time, ensuring items arrive undamaged and on schedule while avoiding cross-border delays.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the transport vehicles are capacity constrained (C), have distance limits (L) to minimize transit time, and each boutique has a time window (TW) for delivery. There is no mention of backhaul demand or open routes, so the most specific variant that fits these criteria is VRPBLTW, which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Capacity, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 25
Description: A renewable energy firm must deploy new solar inverters to remote farms (<loc_customer>) while collecting expired panels for recycling. Delivery trucks (<capacity> kg) start at a depot (<loc_depot>), must complete installations before dusk (<time_windows>). Farmers require service between 8 AM–2 PM to avoid heat stress, and inverters weigh <demand_linehaul> kg. Recycling pickups (<demand_backhaul>) must follow deliveries, as panels cannot be mixed with live equipment. Each route is capped at <distance_limit> km to ensure drivers reach before sunset.
Reason: The problem description specifies that the delivery trucks have a capacity limit, must complete installations before dusk (indicating time window constraints), and that recycling pickups (backhaul) must follow deliveries, meaning backhaul can only occur after all linehaul demands are met. Additionally, there is a distance limit for each route. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBLTW, which accounts for capacity, backhaul with the restriction that it follows linehaul, and time windows, along with distance limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPL, Predicted: VRPL, Index: 79
Description: Marine biologists use drones to deliver coral larvae and restoration tools to remote reef sites (<loc_customer>) damaged by bleaching. Each drone has a limited payload capacity (<capacity> kg) and must stay within a maximum flight distance (<distance_limit> km) dictated by battery life. The drones launch from a research vessel (<loc_depot>), deliver supplies to each reef location, and land at the final site to conserve energy. The goal is to cover all reefs efficiently while adhering to payload and distance constraints.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each drone has a limited payload capacity and must stay within a maximum flight distance, indicating the presence of both capacity (C) and distance limits (L) constraints. Since the drones launch from a research vessel and land at the final site, it implies that the route is not necessarily open (O), as they do not return to the starting depot but do have a defined end point. There are no indications of time windows (TW) or backhaul (B) in the description. Therefore, the most fitting variant is VRPL, which accounts for vehicles having distance limits and, by default, also includes capacity constraints.
