Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 93
Description: A pharmaceutical distributor delivers temperature-sensitive medications (linehaul) to clinics and hospitals while simultaneously collecting expired drugs (backhaul) for secure disposal. Each clinic has a time window for receiving shipments during staffed hours, and expired drug pickups must occur before their scheduled destruction deadlines. Refrigerated trucks have limited capacity for both deliveries and returns, and routes must stay within a 50km radius to maintain cold chain integrity without extended idling. The challenge is to sequence stops efficiently, balancing load constraints and time-sensitive pickups/deliveries.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) with the added complexity of time windows for deliveries and pickups, as well as a distance limit for routes to maintain cold chain integrity. The backhaul (expired drug pickups) can occur simultaneously with linehaul (deliveries), which suggests a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, there is no mention of vehicles needing to return to the depot, implying an open route. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW', which includes open routes (O), mixed backhauls (MB), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).

Description: A medical equipment rental company delivers sterilized devices to clinics and retrieves used units for reprocessing. Clinics require deliveries between 7 AM–9 AM (TW) and pickups by 3 PM (TW). Routes must stay within 100 km (L) to ensure timely returns for overnight sterilization. Each van’s capacity (C) holds both clean devices (linehaul) and dirty containers (backhaul). Drivers may choose delivery or pickup first but must balance loads to prevent exceeding weight limits and delays.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (TW) for deliveries and pickups, distance limits (L) for routes, and mixed backhaul (MB) since both clean devices (linehaul) and dirty containers (backhaul) can be handled simultaneously by the vans. The routes do not necessarily have to return to the depot, as the focus is on timely deliveries and pickups within the specified constraints, indicating an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPMBLTW'.

Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 36
Description: A university’s facilities team needs to distribute lab equipment (e.g., microscopes, sensors) to classrooms and collect them after scheduled lab sessions. Each classroom has a time window during which the equipment must be delivered and later picked up, synchronized with the academic timetable. Vehicles must handle both deliveries and pickups, ensuring that fragile or heavy items do not overload trucks. The challenge is to optimize routes to avoid delays while meeting strict classroom schedules and maximizing equipment reuse across departments.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints ('TW') for deliveries and pickups, as well as backhaul demands ('B') where equipment must be picked up after deliveries are completed. Additionally, there is a mention of ensuring that fragile or heavy items do not overload trucks, which implies capacity constraints ('C'), but since 'B' and 'TW' are present, 'C' is ignored. The problem does not mention distance limits ('L') or open routes ('O'), and the backhaul is not mixed ('MB') because pickups can only occur after deliveries are completed. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPBTW'.

Description: A pharmacy network delivers critical medications to clinics (linehaul) and collects expired drugs for safe disposal (backhaul). Each clinic has time windows for deliveries (to ensure drug efficacy) and pickups (to meet regulatory deadlines). Trucks originate from a central warehouse but finish at their last stop. The objective is to sequence deliveries and pickups efficiently while staying under capacity limits. Early arrivals must wait until the clinic’s opening time, while delays risk drug expiration or compliance violations.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) with time windows for each clinic, and the trucks do not return to the central warehouse (open route). Additionally, there are capacity constraints. The most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows.

Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 66
Description: A farm machinery rental company delivers tractors and harvesters to farms before harvest season and later collects the equipment along with the harvested crops. Vehicles must carry both machinery (deliveries) and crops (pickups) without exceeding capacity. Farms have strict time windows for equipment delivery (to align with planting/harvest schedules) and crop pickup. Routes must be planned to ensure vehicles return to the depot before sunset, adhering to daily distance limits.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there are time window constraints ('TW') for both equipment delivery and crop pickup. Second, the vehicles must carry both machinery (linehaul) and crops (backhaul), which fits the 'backhaul demand' ('B') feature. Third, the vehicles must return to the depot before sunset, which implies a closed route (not 'O'). Additionally, the vehicles have daily distance limits ('L'). Since the backhaul demand can only be satisfied after the linehaul demand is satisfied (equipment must be delivered before crops can be picked up), this is a 'backhaul' ('B') scenario, not a 'mixed backhaul' ('MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW', which combines backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.

Delivery trucks (with a <capacity> kg capacity) start at the warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering packages to <num_customer> locations (<loc_customer>) with specific order weights (<demand_linehaul>). After completing all deliveries, the same trucks must proceed to designated return points (backhaul customers) to collect returned goods (<demand_backhaul>). The route must ensure deliveries precede pickups to prevent overloading during the return phase. Additionally, each truck’s total travel distance must stay under a <distance_limit> km limit to avoid driver fatigue and ensure efficient fuel use. The goal is to minimize total distance while respecting capacity and distance constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, and distance limits (L) for the trucks. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O), and the backhaul is not mixed (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBL'.

Description: A brewery supplies full beer kegs to pubs (linehaul) and collects empties (backhaul) for sterilization. Pubs require kegs delivered before opening hours (e.g., 8 AM) and empties picked up after closing (e.g., 12 AM). Trucks must account for weight differences: a full keg is 150kg, while an empty one is 30kg. A route might first deliver kegs to a busy downtown bar (by 9 AM), then backtrack to collect empties from a suburban pub (by 1 AM), all within a <capacity>-ton limit.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering full kegs) and backhaul (collecting empty kegs) demands, with the backhaul demand being satisfied only after all linehaul demand is met (as per the description). Additionally, there are time window constraints for deliveries and pickups (e.g., deliveries by 8 AM, pickups after 12 AM). The problem does not mention any distance limits for vehicles or open routes (vehicles returning to the depot is implied). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW', which combines backhaul demands with time window constraints.

Description: A pharmaceutical distributor must deliver temperature-sensitive medications to clinics (linehaul) and collect expired drugs or medical waste (backhaul) for secure disposal. Each vehicle has a capacity limit and must stay within a predefined daily travel distance. Routes start at the central warehouse but conclude at the final stop, optimizing both delivery efficiency and waste collection while complying with strict safety regulations.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) where expired drugs or medical waste are collected after all linehaul deliveries are made, vehicles have distance limits (L), and routes start at the central warehouse but conclude at the final stop (O). There is no mention of time window constraints (TW), so they are not considered. The most specific variant that matches these features is 'OVRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 28
Description: A foodservice logistics provider supplies fresh ingredients (e.g., produce, dairy) to restaurants while collecting their food waste for composting. Vehicles (<capacity>) must manage dual loads: delivering perishables (linehaul) and hauling organic waste (backhaul). Routes are designed to start at the central warehouse (<loc_depot>), visit all assigned stops in any sequence, and conclude at the final restaurant. The focus is on minimizing travel distance, preventing spoilage, and ensuring waste is collected without exceeding truck weight limits.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) where waste is collected after delivering perishables, and the routes do not require returning to the depot (O), making it an open route. There is no mention of distance limits (L) or time windows (TW), so these are not considered. The most specific variant that matches these features is 'OVRPB'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 76
Description: A company specializes in setting up temporary event tents and dismantling them post-event. Trucks depart from a warehouse (<loc_depot>) carrying tents, stakes, and equipment (<demand_linehaul>). After assembling tents at event venues (<loc_customer>), crews must retrieve dismantled materials for reuse or disposal (<demand_backhaul>). Time windows (<time_windows>) are critical: deliveries must arrive before event start times, while pickups must occur after event closures. Open routes ensure trucks finish at the last site, maximizing efficiency without returning to base.
Reason: The problem description includes open routes (O), backhaul demand (B), and time windows (TW). The backhaul demand is not mixed (MB) because crews must retrieve dismantled materials only after all deliveries are completed (linehaul demand is satisfied first). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 74
Description: A retail company delivers holiday-specific merchandise to stores and later collects unsold items for redistribution or storage. Each truck has a maximum capacity :math:`Q`, limiting the combined weight of deliveries and pickups. The sequence of deliveries (holiday items) and pickups (returned stock) can be flexible. The central distribution center and 20 retail locations are at <locs>. Delivery demands for holiday items are <demand_linehaul>, and return demands are <demand_backhaul>. The goal is to design routes that minimize transportation costs while efficiently managing both outbound sales and inbound returns without exceeding truck capacities.
Reason: The problem involves both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) demands, with the flexibility to sequence them as long as truck capacities are not exceeded. This matches the 'VRPB' (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls) variant, where backhaul demands can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. There is no mention of distance limits, time windows, or open routes, so these features are not considered.

Description: A gardening company supplies customers with soil, mulch, and plants while collecting organic waste like leaves and grass clippings for composting. Each truck must manage deliveries and pickups within its capacity <capacity>, allowing stops to be sequenced in any order. The depot and 20 customer locations are at <locs>, with supply demands <demand_linehaul> and compost pickup needs <demand_backhaul>. The aim is to create routes that maximize load utilization and minimize travel time while serving all customers efficiently.
Reason: The problem description involves both linehaul (deliveries of soil, mulch, and plants) and backhaul (pickups of organic waste) demands, which can be sequenced in any order as long as the truck's capacity is not exceeded. This matches the 'VRPB' (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls) variant, where backhaul demands are satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), or open routes ('O'), so these features are not considered in the classification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 40
Description: A company provides modular stages, seating, and temporary structures for large-scale events such as concerts, festivals, and conferences. They must deliver infrastructure components (linehaul) to event sites and later retrieve them post-event (backhaul). Each venue has strict time windows for setup and teardown, dictated by event schedules and site access permits. Trucks must manage mixed loads—delivering and returning equipment—without exceeding capacity limits. Routes must ensure timely service within time windows while balancing the order of deliveries and pickups to optimize vehicle utilization.
Reason: The problem description involves delivering infrastructure components (linehaul) and retrieving them post-event (backhaul), which indicates a backhaul demand. Additionally, there are strict time windows for setup and teardown at each venue, indicating time window constraints. The problem also mentions managing mixed loads—delivering and returning equipment—without exceeding capacity limits, which suggests mixed backhaul. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches this description is 'VRPMBLTW', which includes mixed backhaul (MB), backhaul (B), and time windows (TW).

Reason: The problem description involves vehicles that do not return to the depot (open route, 'O'), have backhaul demand ('B'), and there is no mention of distance limits ('L') or time window constraints ('TW'). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches this description is 'OVRPB'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 50
Description: A global shipping port must efficiently redistribute incoming cargo containers to storage yards (linehaul deliveries) while simultaneously collecting empty containers from exporters for return to shipping lines (backhaul pickups). Each container has a time window tied to vessel arrival/departure schedules, requiring precise timing to avoid port congestion. Trucks must dynamically sequence deliveries and pickups to balance the mix of full and empty containers without exceeding capacity, ensuring vessels are serviced on time while minimizing idle time and fuel consumption.
Reason: The problem description involves both linehaul deliveries and backhaul pickups, indicating a backhaul component ('B'). Additionally, there are time window constraints ('TW') tied to vessel arrival/departure schedules. The problem also mentions that trucks must dynamically sequence deliveries and pickups, suggesting that linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, which aligns with the 'mixed backhaul' ('MB') feature. There is no mention of vehicles having to return to the depot, so it is an open route ('O'). There is no mention of distance limits ('L'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 21
Description: An airport catering service must deliver meal trays and supplies to aircraft at specific gates (<loc_customer>) and collect waste from planes after landing. Each gate has a strict time window (<time_window>) aligned with flight schedules. Vehicles start from the depot (<loc_depot>), carrying a mix of outbound supplies and empty waste containers, with a capacity limit (<capacity>). Routes must stay within a maximum distance (<distance_limit>) to ensure timely operations, and drivers finish at the final gate, avoiding return trips. The goal is to synchronize with flight schedules while optimizing cargo capacity and minimizing delays.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, the vehicles do not return to the depot after completing their routes, which corresponds to 'O' (open route). Second, there is a mix of outbound supplies (linehaul) and waste collection (backhaul), which can be satisfied simultaneously, indicating 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Third, there are strict time windows for service at each gate, corresponding to 'TW' (time windows). Additionally, the vehicles have a capacity limit ('C'), but since other features are present, 'C' is ignored. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPMBTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 10
Description: A recycling company must deliver new packaging materials to businesses (linehaul) and collect recyclables from the same locations (backhaul). Each business has strict operating hours (time windows) during which deliveries and pickups must occur. Trucks must deliver supplies first before collecting recyclables to avoid contamination. With a capacity limit of <capacity> kg, routes must balance outbound and inbound loads while ensuring no vehicle returns to the depot after completing all stops.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) that must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is satisfied, time window constraints (TW), and open routes (O) where vehicles do not return to the depot after completing all stops. The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 60
Description: A public health agency deploys mobile testing units to various community sites (<loc_customer>). Each site requires medical supplies (linehaul deliveries) and must have collected samples (backhaul pickups) within strict time windows (<time_windows>). Testing trucks (<capacity> capacity) start from a central medical hub (<loc_depot>), serving sites in any order but ensuring deliveries and pickups don’t exceed vehicle load limits. Routes end at the final stop, as teams remain on-site post-service. Time windows enforce sample freshness and operational hours at each location.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul pickups (B), time windows (TW), and the routes end at the final stop without returning to the depot (O). Additionally, there is a mention of vehicle capacity constraints (C), but since other features (O, B, TW) are present, the capacity constraint is implied and does not need to be explicitly included in the variant name. The most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 12
Description: A medical logistics firm transports lab specimens (e.g., biopsies, blood samples) to diagnostic centers while collecting new blood donation samples from mobile clinics. Specimens have strict time windows (<time_windows>) to ensure viability (e.g., samples must reach labs within 2 hours of collection), while donations must be picked up by 5 PM to meet processing deadlines. The refrigerated trucks (<capacity> liters) must balance space for both temperature-sensitive deliveries and pickups, ensuring no overpacking. Routes may alternate between dropping off urgent specimens and collecting donations, with service times (<service_time>) accounting for sample handling protocols.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints ('TW') for both deliveries and pickups, as well as the need to balance both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) demands simultaneously ('MB'). There is no mention of vehicles needing to return to the depot, suggesting an open route ('O'). The problem does not mention distance limits ('L'), so this feature is not included. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBTW', which combines open routes, mixed backhaul, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 0
Description: A tech company needs to deliver new electronic components to manufacturing sites while collecting outdated devices for recycling. Each truck must balance the weight of outgoing shipments (components) and incoming recyclables (old devices). The route sequence can prioritize either delivery or pickup stops first, as long as the total load (components + recyclables) stays under the vehicle’s capacity <capacity>. The locations of the distribution center and 20 customer sites are <locs>, with delivery demands <demand_linehaul> and pickup demands <demand_backhaul>. The goal is to minimize transportation costs while ensuring no vehicle overloads and all sites are serviced efficiently.
Reason: The problem involves both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) demands, with the requirement that the total load (components + recyclables) must stay under the vehicle’s capacity. The backhaul demand (pickup of recyclables) can be satisfied either before or after the linehaul demand (delivery of components), as long as the total load does not exceed capacity. This matches the definition of 'VRPB' (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls), where backhaul demands are satisfied after all linehaul demands are met. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), or open routes ('O'), so these are not considered.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 2
Description: A construction company sends trucks to deliver building materials (linehaul) to active sites and collect unused debris (backhaul) for recycling. Each truck has a weight capacity and must adhere to a maximum route distance to ensure driver safety and fuel efficiency. Routes begin at the supply depot but end at the last site visited, minimizing detours and maximizing the utility of each vehicle’s load.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) where debris is collected after delivering materials, distance limits (L) for each truck's route, and open routes (O) since trucks end at the last site visited. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.

Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 83
Description: A research team needs to transport sensitive scientific instruments to remote mountain observatories (<loc_customer>) for a solar eclipse study. Each observatory has a strict time window (<time_windows>) for equipment arrival to meet pre-eclipse calibration schedules. Delivery vans (<capacity> kg) must carry heavy gear while adhering to altitude-induced vehicle weight restrictions. Additionally, routes are limited to <distance_limit> km to ensure drivers can return to base camp before nightfall and inclement weather sets in.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), distance limits (<distance_limit> km), and does not mention the need for vehicles to return to the depot (suggesting an open route). Additionally, there is no mention of backhaul demands. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPLTW', which combines open routes (O), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 94
Description: A construction firm uses prefabricated building modules (<demand_linehaul>) for high-rise projects but must also remove on-site waste (<demand_backhaul>) like scrap metal. Construction sites (<loc_customer>) have restricted access windows (<time_windows>) to minimize disruptions—deliveries may only occur during non-working hours, while waste pickups align with cleanup shifts. A truck (<capacity>) might first transport a bathroom module to a site at midnight (outside work hours), then collect debris from another site at 3 PM (during scheduled cleanup). Routes must balance load constraints and respect tight site availability schedules to avoid project delays.  
```
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) where waste is collected after delivering modules, time windows (TW) for deliveries and pickups, and there is no mention of vehicles needing to return to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). The backhaul is not strictly required to be after all linehaul demand is satisfied, as the example shows a truck delivering a module and then collecting debris, indicating mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 22
Description: A mobile grocery service delivers fresh produce in reusable crates to urban neighborhoods (<loc_customer>) while collecting empty crates for redistribution. Trucks must balance outgoing produce (<demand_linehaul>) and returning crates (<demand_backhaul>), never exceeding their capacity (<capacity>). The routes begin at the distribution center (<loc_depot>), end at the last delivery/pickup location, and must stay within a distance limit (<distance_limit>) to ensure timely delivery of perishables.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) where empty crates are collected after delivering produce, distance limits (L) to ensure timely delivery, and the routes do not return to the depot (O). There is no mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL' which combines open routes, backhaul, and distance limits.

Label: VRPMB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 68
Description: A university logistics provider supplies research labs with new equipment while retrieving expired chemicals and hazardous materials for proper disposal. Vehicles must handle both tasks without violating capacity constraints, ensuring safe and efficient handling of sensitive materials.
Reason: The problem description involves both delivering new equipment (linehaul) and retrieving expired chemicals and hazardous materials (backhaul). The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature. Additionally, there are capacity constraints ('C') mentioned, but since 'B' is present, 'C' is ignored. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), or open routes ('O'), so the most appropriate variant is 'VRPB'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 70
Description: A chemical logistics company must deliver hazardous materials to industrial facilities (linehaul) and retrieve used containers for recycling (backhaul). Each delivery must occur within the client’s operational hours (TW), while pickups align with environmental regulations. Vehicles have strict capacity limits (C) to avoid overloading. Routes must stay within a daily distance limit (L) to comply with safety protocols. Starting from the depot, drivers first deliver chemicals, then collect waste containers, ending the route at the depot for proper disposal—ensuring no unnecessary return trips beyond the final task.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there is a distinction between linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) demands, with the constraint that backhaul can only be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, which corresponds to 'B'. Secondly, there are time window constraints ('TW') for both deliveries and pickups. Additionally, vehicles have strict capacity limits ('C') and daily distance limits ('L'). The routes start and end at the depot, so it is not an open route ('O' is not applicable). The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'VRPBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.

Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 20
Description: A regional distributor supplies grocery stores with fresh produce in refrigerated trucks starting from the central warehouse (<loc_depot>). Each store (<loc_customer>) requires a specific quantity of goods (<demand>) and must receive deliveries before their morning opening hours (<time_windows>). After unloading, the trucks must collect empty crates left by stores for recycling (<demand_backhaul>). Trucks cannot exceed their <capacity> ton limit and must prioritize deliveries before pickups. Routes must stay within a maximum distance of <distance_limit> km to ensure drivers finish before dusk. The goal is to plan efficient routes that respect time windows, prevent overloading, and avoid unnecessary returns to the depot.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>), and distance limits (<distance_limit>). The backhaul must be prioritized after deliveries, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature. The vehicles must respect distance limits ('L') and time windows ('TW'). There is no mention of vehicles not returning to the depot, so 'O' (open route) is not applicable. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW', which includes backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: An automotive parts supplier delivers new engine components, tires, and accessories to repair shops (<loc_customer>) while picking up used parts for recycling or resale. Vehicles depart from the central warehouse (<loc_depot>), balancing the weight and space of new deliveries (linehaul) and collected used parts (backhaul). Each truck’s capacity (<capacity>) must not be exceeded, and routes must stay within a maximum travel distance (<distance_limit>), ending at the final customer without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem description involves vehicles that do not return to the depot (O), have backhaul demands (B), and distance limits (L). Since the vehicles do not return to the depot, the 'O' attribute is present. The backhaul demands are mentioned where used parts are picked up for recycling or resale, indicating 'B'. Additionally, there is a maximum travel distance constraint, which corresponds to 'L'. There is no mention of time windows, so 'TW' is not included. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 56
Description: An on-demand courier service handles same-day deliveries and returns in a bustling city. Couriers start at a central sorting facility (<loc_depot>) and must visit <num_customer> locations (<loc_customer>) to drop off packages (<demand_linehaul>) and collect returned items (<demand_backhaul>). Each location has strict time windows (e.g., office deliveries between 10 AM–1 PM, residential pickups after 3 PM). The vehicle’s cargo capacity (<capacity>) must balance outgoing and incoming loads dynamically. Routes are capped at <distance_limit> km to ensure same-day completion, ending at the final stop without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that define the specific variant: 1) 'O' (open route, as couriers end at the final stop without returning to the depot), 2) 'B' (backhaul demand, as couriers collect returned items), 3) 'L' (distance limit, as routes are capped at <distance_limit> km), and 4) 'TW' (time windows, as each location has strict time windows). Given these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which combines all these constraints.

Description: A film production company rents out camera gear and lighting equipment to multiple filming locations. Trucks must deliver equipment to set locations with strict start-time windows and later retrieve it post-shoot. Each vehicle’s capacity is constrained by the weight and bulk of equipment. Routes must be planned to stay within daily distance limits, ensuring drivers can service all locations without exceeding travel time. The sequence of deliveries and pickups can be optimized freely to balance efficiency and time constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple features that need to be considered: 1) Time window constraints ('TW') for deliveries and pickups, 2) Vehicle distance limits ('L'), and 3) Backhaul demands ('B') where equipment is picked up after deliveries. However, the backhaul demands can be satisfied freely without strict sequencing (i.e., not strictly after all linehaul demands), which suggests a 'mixed backhaul' ('MB') scenario. Additionally, the problem does not mention that vehicles must return to the depot, implying an 'open route' ('O'). Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW', which includes open routes, mixed backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: A pharmacy delivers prescription medications to patients’ homes while collecting expired drugs for safe disposal. Each delivery/pickup location has a time window (<time_windows>) aligned with patient availability. The delivery vehicle must balance medication quantities (linehaul) and expired drug volumes (backhaul) within its capacity (<capacity>). Routes are designed to serve all stops in any sequence, ending at the final address to minimize travel time and adhere to strict time windows.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (TW), backhaul demand (B) for collecting expired drugs, and linehaul demand for delivering medications. The backhaul demand can be satisfied simultaneously with the linehaul demand, as the vehicle must balance both within its capacity, indicating a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario. Additionally, the routes do not need to return to the depot, as they end at the final address, which suggests an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW', which includes open routes, mixed backhaul, and time windows.

Description: A catering company delivers hot meals to corporate events (<demand_linehaul>) and collects uneaten portions (<demand_backhaul>) for donation or composting. Meals must be delivered within 30 minutes of event start times (<time_windows>), while pickups occur after events conclude. Each vehicle (capacity <capacity> meals) has a 6-hour operating window (<duration_limit>). The goal is to optimize routes so meal deliveries precede pickups, prevent temperature breaches, and ensure timely service without overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B'), time windows ('TW'), and capacity constraints ('C'). However, since 'B' and 'TW' are present, the 'C' is ignored. The backhaul demand must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' feature. Additionally, the time windows are explicitly mentioned for both deliveries and pickups. There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), open routes ('O'), or mixed backhaul ('MB'), so these are not included in the variant. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW'.

Description: A municipal recycling service operates from a central depot (<loc_depot>) and must collect recyclables from some households and deliver new bins to others. Each customer location (<loc_customer>) has a specific time window during which they can be serviced. The service involves either a pickup of recyclables (<demand_backhaul>) or a delivery of bins (<demand_linehaul>), each with a <service_time> duration. The service vehicles have a <capacity> kg capacity and can arrange their routes to include both pickups and deliveries in any sequence, provided they stay within capacity and time constraints. The goal is to minimize total route distance while ensuring all households are serviced on time.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints (TW), mixed backhaul (MB) where both pickups and deliveries can be done in any sequence, and capacity constraints (C). Since 'MB' and 'TW' are present, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBLTW', which accounts for mixed backhaul, time windows, and capacity constraints.

Description: A shipping logistics company must supply offshore vessels with perishable provisions (linehaul) while collecting waste for disposal (backhaul). Each vessel has strict docking time windows ([e_i, l_i]) when crew can receive deliveries or offload waste. Supply boats must not exceed their capacity (C) for both provisions and waste, and each route is constrained by a daily distance limit (L) to avoid fuel shortages. Routes end at the final stop (O), as crews return via alternative transport.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), time windows (TW), and open routes (O). The backhaul demand is specified to be collected after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with 'B' rather than 'MB'. The problem also specifies that routes end at the final stop, indicating an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these constraints is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A research organization supplies field equipment (e.g., sensors, lab kits) to remote research stations in Arctic or jungle regions and later retrieves used gear for maintenance. Deliveries and pickups must occur during narrow time windows when ice roads or seasonal weather permit access. Vehicles must handle fragile scientific instruments while adhering to strict weight and space constraints.
Reason: The problem description mentions 'Deliveries and pickups must occur during narrow time windows when ice roads or seasonal weather permit access', which indicates the presence of time window constraints ('TW'). Additionally, the problem involves both delivering equipment to research stations and picking up used gear for maintenance, which suggests a backhaul demand ('B'). The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand (deliveries) are completed, as the equipment must be delivered before it can be used and later picked up. There is no mention of vehicles not returning to the depot, so it is not an open route ('O'). There is also no mention of distance limits for vehicles ('L'). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPBTW', which includes both backhaul demand and time window constraints.

Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPMLB, Index: 0
Description: A recycling company operates from a central depot (<loc_depot>) and needs to collect recyclables from <num_customer> commercial businesses while also delivering empty recycling containers to new clients. Each truck has a <capacity> kg capacity and must return to the depot within a <distance_limit> km limit. Businesses either require a delivery of containers (linehaul) or a pickup of filled containers (backhaul), and routes can mix these tasks in any order. The goal is to minimize total distance while ensuring no truck exceeds its weight limit and all routes stay within the distance cap.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivery of empty containers) and backhaul (pickup of filled containers) tasks that can be mixed in any order, which corresponds to 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Additionally, the vehicles have a distance limit ('L') and must return to the depot (not open route, so 'O' is not applicable). There is no mention of time windows ('TW'), so that is not included. The problem also involves capacity constraints ('C'), but since 'MB' and 'L' are present, 'C' is ignored as per the given rules.

Description: A foodservice provider supplies fresh produce and supplies to restaurants (linehaul) and collects organic waste for composting (backhaul). Restaurants specify time windows for deliveries (to ensure ingredient freshness) and pickups (to align with waste management schedules). Trucks begin at a central kitchen but conclude at their final stop. The challenge is to interleave deliveries and pickups without exceeding vehicle capacity, ensuring compliance with time windows. Missed deadlines could lead to food waste or regulatory penalties.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) demands, which can be interleaved (mixed backhaul). It also includes time window constraints for both deliveries and pickups. Additionally, the trucks do not return to the central kitchen after their final stop, indicating an open route. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW', which includes open routes, mixed backhaul, distance limits (implied by capacity constraints), and time windows.

Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 98
Description: A renewable energy firm replaces turbine blades at offshore wind farms, delivering new blades while collecting old ones for recycling. Each transport vessel has a capacity constraint for both new and old blades. Routes must stay within a maximum distance to ensure safe travel and efficient fuel use, as vessels must return to port before running low on fuel. The sequence of blade delivery and collection stops can be optimized to balance cargo and minimize travel time.
Reason: The problem involves delivering new blades (linehaul) and collecting old blades (backhaul) with capacity constraints for both types of cargo. The vessels must return to port, indicating it is not an open route ('O'). The routes have a maximum distance constraint ('L'), but there is no mention of time windows ('TW'). The backhaul demand (collecting old blades) can be satisfied only after delivering new blades, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBL'.

Description: A renewable energy company must service offshore wind turbines located in remote oceanic areas. Their vessels deliver maintenance parts (e.g., lubricants, components) to each turbine and collect scrap metal or outdated equipment for recycling. Each vessel has a limited capacity to carry both outbound supplies and inbound scrap. Routes must stay within a maximum travel distance to ensure safe return to the depot without refueling. The challenge is to plan efficient routes balancing delivery and pickup loads while covering all turbine sites.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles with limited capacity (C), the need to balance delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) loads (B), and a maximum travel distance constraint (L). Since the vehicles must return to the depot, it is not an open route (O), and there is no mention of time windows (TW). The backhaul demand (pickup) can be satisfied simultaneously with the linehaul demand (delivery), indicating a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBL, which includes mixed backhaul, capacity, and distance limits.

Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 71
Description: A renewable energy firm deploys solar panels and wind turbine components to remote locations (linehaul) while picking up scrap metal from decommissioned equipment (backhaul). Delivery trucks start at a central warehouse but finish at their last stop, eliminating return journeys. Capacity constraints mandate that the combined weight of new installations and recycled scrap stays within vehicle limits. The challenge is to design routes that maximize resource utilization, reduce transportation costs, and ensure timely deployment of clean energy infrastructure.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) where vehicles do not return to the depot, backhaul demand (B) for picking up scrap metal after delivering new installations, and capacity constraints (C) on the combined weight of new installations and recycled scrap. Although there are capacity constraints, the presence of 'O' and 'B' attributes takes precedence over 'C'. There is no mention of distance limits (L) or time windows (TW), so those are not included. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRPB'.

Description: A logistics firm handles booth assembly for a city-wide trade show, delivering materials like display stands and promotional items to venues (linehaul) and later collecting dismantled equipment (backhaul). Venues require setup completion by opening day (TW), while teardown must occur post-event. Trucks (capacity <capacity>) must optimize mixed routes, balancing cargo limits and time constraints for venue access periods. Routes terminate at the last collection stop (O), ensuring efficient use of resources.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demands (B), time window constraints (TW), and specifies that routes terminate at the last collection stop (O), indicating an open route. The backhaul demands are only satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, which aligns with the 'B' feature. The time windows are explicitly mentioned for both setup and teardown, fitting the 'TW' feature. The open route aspect is clearly stated, matching the 'O' feature. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBTW', which combines open routes with backhaul demands and time windows.

Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 56
Description: An airport’s ground operations team needs to redistribute equipment like baggage trolleys and pushback tractors between terminals. Some terminals require deliveries of equipment, while others have excess to return (pickups). Vehicles must adhere to strict time windows aligned with flight schedules to avoid disruptions. Each truck has a capacity limit for equipment, and routes must stay within the airport’s operational boundaries (distance limit) to ensure timely returns for refueling or reassignment.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there are backhaul demands (terminals with excess equipment to return, denoted as 'B'). Second, vehicles have distance limits ('L') to ensure timely returns for refueling or reassignment. Third, there are strict time windows ('TW') aligned with flight schedules. Additionally, the problem does not explicitly state that vehicles must return to a depot, but the mention of 'timely returns for refueling or reassignment' suggests closed routes (not 'O'). Therefore, the most specific variant that captures all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPTW, Predicted: OVRPTW, Index: 36
Description: A tech conference organizer needs to deploy servers to multiple venues for simultaneous workshops. Server delivery locations (<locs>) must align with venue setup schedules, with time windows <time_windows> to ensure readiness. Each venue requires <demand> servers, and service time <service_time> includes setup coordination. Delivery trucks can carry up to <capacity> servers and travel at <speed> km/h. The goal is to route trucks from the central staging area to all venues, respecting time constraints and maximizing server delivery efficiency.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints (<time_windows>) for server delivery, which aligns with the 'TW' feature. Additionally, there is no mention of vehicles needing to return to the depot, suggesting an open route ('O'). There is no indication of backhaul demand or distance limits for the vehicles. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the description is 'OVRPTW', which combines open routes with time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPL, Predicted: OVRPL, Index: 27
Description: A solar energy company is installing panels in a remote desert region. Heavy equipment and materials must be transported from the central depot (<loc_depot>) to installation sites at <loc_customer>. Each truck can carry up to <capacity> kg of equipment, and desert terrain limits daily travel to <distance_limit> km to avoid mechanical failure. Sites require <demand> kg of materials. Optimize routes to ensure all sites are supplied without exceeding vehicle capacities or daily distance limits.
Reason: The problem description mentions that each truck has a capacity limit ('C'), the vehicles have daily distance limits ('L'), and there is no mention of backhaul demand ('B'), mixed backhaul ('MB'), or time windows ('TW'). Additionally, the vehicles are not required to return to the depot, which implies an open route ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPL' as it includes the open route and distance limit constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 54
Description: Farmers in a seasonal agricultural region need tractors and harvesters delivered to fields before planting/harvesting windows (linehaul) and have used machinery collected afterward (backhaul). Time windows are dictated by crop cycles and weather forecasts, demanding precise timing to avoid delays. Trucks must handle both machinery transport and organic waste pickup (e.g., crop residue) without overloading, navigating rural routes efficiently while adhering to strict agricultural timelines and capacity limits.
Reason: The problem description involves both linehaul (delivering machinery to fields) and backhaul (collecting machinery and organic waste), which must be handled without overloading, indicating a backhaul demand. Additionally, the mention of 'strict agricultural timelines' and 'precise timing to avoid delays' suggests time window constraints. The problem does not specify that vehicles must return to the depot, but it does not explicitly state they are open routes either, so we default to assuming they return to the depot. There is no mention of distance limits for the vehicles. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'VRPBTW', which includes backhaul and time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 95
Description: A preservation organization must deliver conservation tools, materials, and protective gear to remote archaeological sites scattered across a mountainous region. After completing deliveries (linehaul), vehicles must collect damaged artifacts for restoration at a central museum. Each vehicle has a maximum capacity, and routes must not exceed a strict distance limit to ensure safe operation without refueling. The goal is to plan efficient routes that first service all sites with supplies before retrieving artifacts, ensuring no vehicle overloads or exceeds its travel range.
Reason: The problem description involves delivering supplies (linehaul) before collecting artifacts (backhaul), which corresponds to 'B' (backhaul demand). Additionally, vehicles have a maximum capacity ('C') and a strict distance limit ('L'). There is no mention of time windows ('TW') or open routes ('O'), and the backhaul demand must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is met, which is characteristic of 'B' rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBL', which includes capacity, backhaul, and distance limits.

Routes are restricted by distance (L) to ensure timely service, ending at the final site (O).
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul (B), distance limits (L), time windows (TW), and open routes (O). The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul, Distance Limits, and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 24
Description: A seafood supplier delivers fresh fish to restaurants and collects used ice blocks for recycling. Trucks must balance the weight of perishable goods and bulky ice containers, ensuring the combined load does not exceed capacity :math:`Q`. The warehouse and 20 restaurant locations are <locs>, with delivery demands <demand_linehaul> (fish) and pickup demands <demand_backhaul> (ice). The challenge is minimizing transportation costs while maintaining freshness standards and efficiently reusing ice materials.
Reason: The problem description involves both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) demands, which must be balanced without exceeding the truck's capacity. The backhaul (ice) can only be collected after all linehaul (fish) deliveries are completed, as freshness standards must be maintained. There is no mention of distance limits, time windows, or open routes, so the most specific variant is 'VRPB' (Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 13
Description: A same-day courier service delivers urgent medical supplies (linehaul) to clinics and collects returned packages (backhaul). Vehicles are limited to <capacity> kg. Routes begin at the sorting hub (<loc_depot>), deliver high-priority items first, and then pick up returned goods. Each customer specifies a time window (<time_windows>) for service, such as morning delivery and afternoon pickup. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius to ensure timely completion. The challenge is to balance speed with capacity constraints while avoiding depot returns.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' feature. The vehicles have distance limits (L), and there are time window constraints (TW) for service. Additionally, the routes must stay within a certain radius, implying a distance limit, and the problem does not mention that vehicles do not have to return to the depot, so it is not an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 96
Description: Airport ground crew supervisors must redistribute luggage carts, fuel hoses, and safety equipment to active gates while collecting unused gear from closed terminals. Vehicles (capacity <capacity>) depart the equipment hub (<loc_depot>), serving <num_customer> gate locations (<loc_customer>). Deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) align with incoming flights, while pickups (<demand_backhaul>) depend on post-flight clearance times. Each gate has a service window (<time_windows>) tied to aircraft arrival/departure schedules. Routes are open-ended—crews finish at the last gate served, avoiding redundant return trips during peak operations.
Reason: The problem description includes open-ended routes ('O'), backhaul demand ('B'), and time window constraints ('TW'). The vehicles do not have to return to the depot, which is indicated by 'O'. There are both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul), and the service must occur within specific time windows tied to aircraft schedules. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBTW'.

Description: A film production company needs to transport lighting rigs, cameras, and props (<demand_linehaul>) to remote filming locations while collecting discarded set materials, empty containers, and unused equipment (<demand_backhaul>). Trucks departing from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>) must balance their capacity (<capacity>) between deliveries and pickups. Routes are open-ended, ending at the last filming site to streamline logistics. To adhere to tight production schedules and environmental policies, each truck’s total travel distance must not exceed a predefined limit (<distance_limit>).
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O), backhaul demand (B), and distance limits (L). The routes are open-ended (O), meaning trucks do not return to the depot. There is a need to balance capacity between deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) (B). Additionally, each truck's total travel distance must not exceed a predefined limit (L). There is no mention of time window constraints (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB), so these are not included in the variant.

Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 89
Description: A coastal tourism company delivers recreational gear (e.g., kayaks, snorkeling equipment) to remote beaches and collects marine debris (e.g., plastic waste) for recycling. Each boat has a capacity to carry both outbound gear and inbound waste. Routes must stay within a distance limit to ensure safe return to the base. The challenge is to plan routes that efficiently serve all tourism sites while contributing to environmental cleanup.
Reason: The problem involves delivering recreational gear (linehaul) and collecting marine debris (backhaul), which can be considered as mixed backhaul (MB) since both activities can occur simultaneously during the route. Additionally, the routes have a distance limit (L) to ensure safe return to the base. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O), so these are not considered. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBL, which accounts for mixed backhaul and distance limits.

Description: Medical linen providers must deliver fresh linens to surgical units and collect soiled garments from patient wards across a hospital network. Each vehicle (capacity <capacity>) starts at the central laundry depot (<loc_depot>) and services <num_customer> locations (<loc_customer>). Delivery demands (<demand_linehaul>) and pickup volumes (<demand_backhaul>) vary per department, requiring flexible route sequencing. Nurses require linen replenishment by morning shift start (<time_windows>) and contaminated items must be removed before infection control deadlines. Trucks can end their routes at the final stop without returning to base, ensuring efficient capacity use while respecting strict hygiene timelines.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, the vehicles do not have to return to the depot ('O'). Second, there are both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) demands ('B'). Third, there are time window constraints for deliveries and pickups ('TW'). Additionally, the backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously with linehaul demands (implied by the need for flexible route sequencing), which suggests 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPMBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 6
Description: A linen service provider manages <num_customer> hotels, delivering fresh linens and collecting soiled ones. Each hotel specifies a time window (<time_windows>) when housekeeping is active (e.g., morning shifts). Trucks from the depot (<loc_depot>) have a capacity limit (<capacity>) to handle both clean and soiled linen loads. Routes must not exceed a daily distance cap (<distance_limit> km) to avoid overtime, while ensuring pickups and deliveries are sequenced efficiently without violating hotel schedules.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows for hotel service ('TW'), distance limits for routes ('L'), and backhaul operations (collecting soiled linens after delivering fresh ones, which is a 'B' feature since backhaul can only be satisfied after linehaul is completed). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 96
Description: A marine archaeology team deploys submersibles to underwater excavation sites (<loc_customer>) to deliver tools and retrieve ancient artifacts. Each submersible has a maximum capacity (<capacity> kg) for carrying both supplies and artifacts. Supplies (e.g., diving gear, sensors) must be delivered first before collecting artifacts to prevent damage. The submersibles’ battery life restricts their maximum travel distance (<distance_limit> km) from the research vessel (<loc_depot>). The goal is to optimize routes to maximize artifact recovery while adhering to capacity and range limits.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B) where supplies must be delivered before artifacts can be collected, distance limits (L) due to battery life restrictions, and the submersibles do not necessarily have to return to the depot (O) as they can stay at the excavation sites. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL' which combines open routes, backhaul demand, and distance limits.

Label: CVRP, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 20
Description: A dairy cooperative operates a central processing plant (<loc_depot>) and collects raw milk from <num_customer> farms, then sends it to the central processing plant. Each farm supplies a specific daily volume (<demand> liters), and the trucks (<capacity> liters capacity) must first collect milk from farms before delivering it to processing hubs. The challenge is to design routes where the total milk collected from farms plus the milk loaded for delivery does not exceed the truck’s capacity at any point. The goal is to minimize fuel costs while ensuring all farms are serviced and milk is efficiently transported to processing centers without overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem description involves collecting milk from farms (linehaul) and delivering it to a central processing plant (backhaul), with a constraint that the total milk collected plus the milk loaded for delivery does not exceed the truck's capacity at any point. This matches the definition of 'B' (backhaul demand which can be satisfied only when all the linehaul demand is satisfied). There is no mention of distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), or open routes ('O'), so the most appropriate variant is 'VRPB'.

Description: A wind farm operator must send maintenance crews to service offshore turbines. Each turbine requires a specific set of tools and crew members (<demand>), and can only be accessed during tidal windows (<time_windows>). Maintenance vessels (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a coastal depot (<loc_depot>), must return before depleting fuel (<distance_limit> km), and must prioritize urgent repairs. Routes must ensure all turbines are serviced within their operational windows while avoiding excessive travel for crews.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. The mention of 'tidal windows (<time_windows>)' indicates the presence of time window constraints (TW). The requirement that maintenance vessels 'must return before depleting fuel (<distance_limit> km)' suggests distance limits (L). Additionally, the problem involves servicing turbines with specific demands, but there is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, nor is there any indication that the vehicles do not have to return to the depot (O is not present). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the description is 'VRPLTW', which includes both distance limits and time window constraints.

Description: A construction company needs to deliver building supplies to active job sites (<loc_customer>) and collect construction waste for recycling. Each truck (<capacity> ton capacity) starts at the central depot (<loc_depot>), first delivering materials to sites during their operational hours (time windows <time_windows>). After completing deliveries, trucks must return to the same route to pick up pre-sorted waste from the same sites. The challenge is to sequence routes so deliveries precede pickups, respect site-specific time windows, and avoid overloading trucks while ending tours at the final stop.
Reason: The problem description involves delivering materials to sites before picking up waste (backhaul demand), time windows for site operations, and trucks returning to the depot (not open route). The key features are backhaul demand (B) and time windows (TW), and the vehicles must return to the depot, so it's not an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW'.

Routes are constrained by a maximum distance (<distance_limit>) to focus on regional coverage, ending at the last dealership without returning to the warehouse (<loc_depot>). The goal is to minimize travel costs while respecting dealer schedules and vehicle limits.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B'), distance limits ('L'), time windows ('TW'), and open routes ('O'). The backhaul demand is specified as obsolete inventory collection, which can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand (replacement parts redistribution) is satisfied, indicating a backhaul ('B') rather than mixed backhaul ('MB') scenario. The vehicles have payload limits ('capacity'), but since other features are present, 'C' is ignored. The routes are constrained by maximum distance ('L'), dealerships have specific operating hours ('TW'), and vehicles do not return to the warehouse ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW'.

The manure collection process adds variable weight, requiring precise route planning to stay within each vehicle’s capacity (<capacity>). Routes conclude at the final farm, eliminating redundant return trips to reduce fuel costs and environmental impact.
Reason: The problem description involves backhaul demand (manure collection) which can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand (feed deliveries) is satisfied ('B'). Additionally, the routes conclude at the final farm without returning to the depot ('O'). There is also a capacity constraint ('C') due to variable weight from manure collection. Since 'O' and 'B' are present, the most specific variant is 'OVRPB'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 81
Description: During a severe drought, a water utility company must deliver full water tanks to parched communities while retrieving empty ones for refilling. The depot (<loc_depot>) sends trucks with a <capacity> liter capacity to <num_customer> distribution points. Each site requires a specific volume of water (<demand_linehaul>) and has a quota of empty tanks to return (<demand_backhaul>). Routes must balance both tasks without exceeding weight limits, as tanks are heavy when full. To prevent overextension, each truck’s round-trip distance cannot exceed <distance_limit> kilometers, ensuring rapid redistribution cycles and minimal downtime for refilling operations.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) where empty tanks must be retrieved after delivering full ones, distance limits (L) for each truck's round-trip, and there is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O). The backhaul demand is satisfied only after the linehaul demand is met, which aligns with the 'B' feature. The distance limit is explicitly mentioned, which corresponds to the 'L' feature. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBL'.

Description: A catering company supplies cooking equipment (stoves, utensils, generators) to corporate event venues and later retrieves it. Deliveries must occur before pickups to ensure equipment readiness for events. Each truck has a capacity limit. Venues have setup time windows (before the event) and pickup deadlines afterward. The aim is to optimize routes for minimal distance, respecting capacity and time constraints, with vehicles ending their routes at the final pickup point.
Reason: The problem description involves backhaul demands (pickup of equipment after delivery), time window constraints (setup time windows and pickup deadlines), and vehicles ending their routes at the final pickup point (open route). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes (O), backhaul demands (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: VRPTW, Index: 88
Description: A telecom provider must deploy satellite hotspots to remote areas for an event and retrieve them post-event. Deployment must occur within the event’s start time window, while retrieval is scheduled after its conclusion. Trucks (<capacity> capacity) first deliver the equipment and later collect it, ensuring capacity constraints are met. Routes must align with connectivity deadlines to avoid service gaps, prioritizing efficiency and adherence to strict timelines.
Reason: The problem involves delivering satellite hotspots to remote areas within a specific time window (event’s start time) and retrieving them after the event concludes, which introduces time window constraints ('TW'). Additionally, the trucks have a specified capacity ('C'), but since 'TW' is present, capacity is considered secondary. There is no mention of vehicles not returning to the depot, so 'O' is not applicable. The retrieval of equipment after the event can be seen as backhaul demand, but since the description does not explicitly state that backhaul can only be done after all deliveries are completed or that they can be mixed, we default to the simpler time-constrained variant. Thus, the most specific variant is 'VRPTW'.

Description: A chain of restaurants requires fresh ingredients delivered before their morning prep (<demand_linehaul>) and empty dishware collected afterward (<demand_backhaul>). Trucks depart from a central commissary (<loc_depot>), must arrive at each restaurant within their designated service hours (<time_windows>), and cannot exceed capacity limits for both deliveries and pickups. The route design must ensure ingredients are dropped off first, followed by dish collection, with drivers concluding their day at the last stop.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), time windows (TW), and specifies that the route is open (O) as drivers conclude their day at the last stop. Additionally, there are capacity constraints for both deliveries and pickups, but these are secondary to the other features. The most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A home appliance retailer delivers new refrigerators, washing machines, and other appliances to customers’ homes while collecting old electronics for recycling. Customers specify appointment windows (time windows) for installation or pickup. Delivery trucks must balance the weight and space of bulky new appliances with the volume of e-waste (capacity constraint). Routes are limited by distance to minimize fuel costs and ensure technicians can return to the depot within a single shift.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (TW) for customer appointments, backhaul demand (B) for collecting old electronics, and distance limits (L) for the routes. Additionally, the vehicles must return to the depot, so it is not an open route (O). The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which is characteristic of a backhaul (B) rather than a mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPBLTW, which includes backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 85
Description: A research organization must deliver specialized equipment (e.g., sensors, lab gear) to remote field sites for environmental studies. Each site has a strict time window for equipment delivery (due to permit restrictions) and a later pickup window after the study concludes. Vehicles must first deliver equipment (linehaul) before collecting unused/used items (backhaul). Each truck has a capacity limit to ensure it doesn’t overload. The goal is to minimize travel distance while respecting time windows and capacity constraints, with routes ending at the final pickup location.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demands (B) that must be satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, time window constraints (TW) for delivery and pickup, and capacity constraints (C). The routes end at the final pickup location, which implies they do not return to the depot (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which combines open routes (O), backhaul (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).

Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 22
Description: A healthcare provider rents specialized medical devices (e.g., wheelchairs, monitors) to patients and schedules pickups after their recovery. Delivery trucks (<capacity> devices) must first deliver equipment to patients’ homes (<time_windows>) before returning to collect devices from others. Each route is restricted to a 7-hour duration (<duration_limit>), and vehicles must not exceed their capacity during combined delivery and pickup loads. The solution must balance urgency of deliveries with efficient backhaul scheduling.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demands (pickup of devices after delivery), and a duration limit (<duration_limit>), which corresponds to distance limits. The vehicles must return to the depot after completing their routes, so it is not an open route. The backhaul demands are mixed with linehaul demands (deliveries and pickups can occur in the same route), and there are time window constraints. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 34
Description: During flood relief efforts, shelters require urgent supplies delivery and later material collection for redistribution. Vehicles transport essentials like tents and food (<demand_linehaul>) to disaster zones and retrieve reusable items (<demand_backhaul>). Each route must originate from a central depot (<loc_depot>), stay within a maximum travel distance (<distance_limit>), and conclude at the final shelter. The sequence of deliveries and pickups is flexible to prioritize urgent needs while adhering to capacity and distance limits.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>) which can be satisfied after linehaul demand (<demand_linehaul>), vehicles have distance limits (<distance_limit>), and routes do not need to return to the depot (they conclude at the final shelter). This matches the 'OVRPBL' variant, which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Distance Limits.

Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 82
Description: A logistics provider delivers stalls, equipment, and supplies (linehaul) to farmers' markets, which must arrive before setup begins (TW). After markets close, trucks collect waste, disassembled stalls, and unsold produce (backhaul). Vehicles have capacity constraints for mixed cargo and must return to the depot within a set distance limit to ensure timely cleanup. The goal is to coordinate deliveries and pickups efficiently while adhering to market operating hours and avoiding overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are time window constraints (TW) as the deliveries must arrive before setup begins and pickups must occur after markets close. Secondly, there is backhaul demand (B) where trucks collect waste, disassembled stalls, and unsold produce after delivering the linehaul. Thirdly, the vehicles have distance limits (L) as they must return to the depot within a set distance limit. Additionally, the backhaul can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which is a characteristic of 'B' rather than 'MB'. The vehicles must return to the depot, so it is not an open route (O is not present). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.

Description: A maintenance crew delivers replacement parts, repair tools, and safety gear to offshore wind turbines (linehaul) for scheduled upkeep. After repairs, they collect used materials and waste for disposal (backhaul). Time windows are dictated by tidal patterns and weather conditions, requiring precise arrival and departure times. Vehicles must deliver all linehaul items before initiating pickups, adhering to strict capacity (<capacity>) limits. Routes end at the last turbine visited, as returning to the depot risks missing optimal weather windows for subsequent missions.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there is a backhaul demand (B) where used materials and waste are collected after all linehaul items are delivered. Second, the routes are open (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot. Third, there are time window constraints (TW) dictated by tidal patterns and weather conditions. Additionally, there is a capacity constraint (<capacity>), but this is secondary to the other features. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 71
Description: A grocery chain operates in a city, delivering fresh produce to stores (linehaul) and collecting food waste for composting (backhaul). Deliveries must occur before stores open (TW), while pickups happen after closing hours (TW). Trucks (C) are limited in size to fit city streets, and routes must not exceed municipal distance limits (L) to reduce emissions. Drivers begin at the central depot, deliver produce, then collect waste, concluding at the depot for processing—without redundant returns to reduce fuel use.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW). The backhaul demand must be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met, which aligns with the 'B' feature. The trucks have distance limits (L) and must adhere to time windows (TW) for deliveries and pickups. The vehicles must return to the depot, so it is not an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW'.

Description: A space agency dispatches specialized trucks to deliver satellite components to remote launch sites (<loc_customer>) and retrieve scientific payloads from completed missions. Vehicles (<capacity>) must stay within a daily travel limit (<distance_limit>) due to harsh terrain. Each site has a narrow time window (<time_windows>) for access (e.g., during clear weather or specific launch windows). Routes conclude at the final destination, with payloads transferred to awaiting aircraft instead of returning to the depot (<loc_depot>).
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, the vehicles do not return to the depot after completing their routes, which corresponds to the 'O' (open route) feature. Second, there are backhaul demands (retrieving scientific payloads) which can only be satisfied after delivering the satellite components (linehaul demands), aligning with the 'B' (backhaul) feature. Third, the vehicles have a daily travel limit due to harsh terrain, which matches the 'L' (distance limits) feature. Finally, each site has narrow time windows for access, corresponding to the 'TW' (time window constraints) feature. Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A furniture retailer operates a "trade-in" program where customers receive new furniture deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) and simultaneously have old furniture picked up (<demand_backhaul>). Delivery trucks start from the main warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering new items to households, then collecting discarded furniture from other customers. The trucks must never exceed their weight capacity (<capacity>), and pickups can only occur after all deliveries on the route are finalized. The challenge is to balance load distribution and route efficiency to reduce total driving distance while ensuring timely service for both delivery and recycling requests.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, and there is a capacity constraint (C). However, since 'B' is present, 'C' is ignored. There is no mention of distance limits (L), time windows (TW), or open routes (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPB'.

Description: A specialized events company builds temporary stages and structures for concerts, festivals, and conventions. They must deliver construction materials (e.g., steel beams, lighting rigs) to event venues and later dismantle and collect the equipment post-event. Vehicles have capacity constraints that account for both outbound deliveries (heavy materials) and inbound pickups (disassembled components). Routes start at the staging warehouse (<loc_depot>), visit sites for setup or teardown in any sequence, and terminate at the last stop without returning. The focus is on minimizing travel distance while managing payload weights and ensuring all equipment is safely transported.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles do not return to the depot, indicated by 'O'), backhaul demand (equipment is collected post-event, indicated by 'B'), and capacity constraints (vehicles have payload weight limits, indicated by 'C'). However, since 'O' and 'B' are present, 'C' is ignored. The most specific variant that matches these features is 'OVRPB' (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul). There is no mention of distance limits ('L') or time windows ('TW'), so these are not included in the variant.

Description: A company deploys new EV charging stations across a city while managing battery swap services for existing stations. Deliveries include installation components (e.g., hardware, cables), and pickups involve used batteries for recycling. Installations must occur within city permit time windows to avoid traffic disruptions. Trucks must balance the weight of equipment with the volume of batteries. Routes end at the final service stop to minimize idle time. The aim is to minimize travel distance while adhering to capacity and time constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple constraints and features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are time window constraints ('TW') for installations within city permit time windows. Secondly, there is a backhaul component ('B') involving pickups of used batteries for recycling, which must be managed alongside deliveries. Additionally, the routes end at the final service stop, indicating an open route ('O'). The problem also mentions balancing weight and volume, which implies capacity constraints, but these are secondary to the more specific features like time windows, backhaul, and open routes. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBTW', which combines open routes, backhaul, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 46
Description: Medical supply chains face urgent demands to deliver ventilators and medications to hospitals while simultaneously collecting expired drugs and contaminated PPE for disposal. Hospitals operate under strict operational hours (time windows), requiring vehicles to balance deliveries and pickups in flexible routes. Capacity constraints are critical due to the bulkiness of medical equipment, and vehicles must optimize routes to avoid overloading while adhering to healthcare compliance timelines.
Reason: The problem description involves both deliveries and pickups (backhaul), time windows for hospital operations, and capacity constraints due to bulky medical equipment. The backhaul is described as flexible, implying that deliveries and pickups can be handled simultaneously (mixed backhaul). Additionally, the vehicles must adhere to healthcare compliance timelines, indicating time window constraints. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBLTW', which includes mixed backhaul (MB), capacity constraints (implied by C but overridden by MB), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).

Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 84
Description: A network of temporary farmers' markets requires daily setup (linehaul deliveries of stalls, produce, and equipment) and post-event inventory retrieval (backhaul pickups of unsold goods). Markets operate within strict operating hours (e.g., 8:00 AM–2:00 PM), so deliveries must arrive by 7:30 AM, and pickups must occur by 2:30 PM. Trucks must balance the volume of setup materials and perishable returns within their <capacity> cubic meters. Drivers finish at the last market location to streamline logistics and reduce fuel costs.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), time window constraints (TW), and specifies that drivers finish at the last market location (O for open route). The backhaul demand is only satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with 'B' rather than 'MB'. The problem does not mention any distance limits (L), so it is not included. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBTW'.

Description: A seafood company supplies fish feed to aquaculture farms (<loc_customer>) and collects harvested seafood for processing. Farms operate within time windows (<time_window>) dictated by tidal schedules or processing plant availability. Vehicles departing from the depot (<loc_depot>) must transport feed (deliveries) and empty crates (for pickups) within their capacity (<capacity>). Routes are limited by a daily distance threshold (<distance_limit>), ending at the last farm served. The goal is to synchronize supply and collection operations, respect strict timeframes to preserve freshness, and avoid overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple features that define the variant. Specifically, it mentions backhaul demand (B) where vehicles transport feed (linehaul) and empty crates (backhaul), distance limits (L) with a daily distance threshold, time windows (TW) dictated by tidal schedules or processing plant availability, and open routes (O) where vehicles end at the last farm served. Given these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which combines open routes, backhaul demand, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: A film production company must deliver heavy filming equipment (e.g., cranes, lighting rigs) to multiple outdoor locations (C) for scenes with strict shoot schedules (TW). Trucks have limited cargo space and drivers are restricted to daily driving limits (L) under labor regulations. The logistics team must coordinate routes to ensure equipment arrives precisely when filming starts, without overloading vehicles or exceeding driver hour limits.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple outdoor locations (C), strict shoot schedules (TW), limited cargo space (C), and daily driving limits (L). The presence of time windows (TW) and driving limits (L) suggests that the problem is a variant of VRP with these constraints. Additionally, the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot after deliveries, indicating an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is OVRPLTW, which combines open routes, driving limits, and time windows.

Description: Rescued wildlife from multiple rehabilitation centers must be transferred to a central sanctuary. Each center permits pickups only during specific hours (e.g., 8:00 AM–10:00 AM for health checks) to minimize animal stress. Transport vehicles have restricted space to accommodate animal carriers and safety protocols, and routes must stay within a maximum distance to prevent exhaustion during transit. Drivers must balance urgency with safe driving limits to ensure all animals arrive within their assigned time windows.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are time window constraints ('TW') as each center permits pickups only during specific hours. Secondly, the vehicles have distance limits ('L') to prevent exhaustion during transit. Additionally, the problem involves backhaul demand ('B') as the vehicles are picking up animals from multiple centers to deliver them to a central sanctuary, which can be considered a backhaul operation after the linehaul (delivery) is completed. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.

Description: Marine archaeologists require specialized equipment (diving gear, sonar arrays) to be delivered to underwater excavation sites and must later retrieve recovered artifacts. Submersible support vessels (<capacity> m³) have a strict distance limit (<distance_limit>) due to limited battery life. Deliveries must occur first, followed by artifact pickups, with time windows (<time_window>) dictated by safe diving conditions during low tide. Expeditions must conclude before tidal shifts complicate retrieval operations.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there is a backhaul demand (B) where deliveries must occur before artifact pickups, which is a strict backhaul scenario. Second, the submersible support vessels have a strict distance limit (L) due to limited battery life. Third, there are time window constraints (TW) dictated by safe diving conditions during low tide. Additionally, the problem does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, which suggests an open route (O). Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: A construction firm requires timely material delivery (linehaul) to active sites and waste pickup (backhaul) post-work hours. Each site has strict access times (TW) for deliveries and pickups. Trucks (C) must carry heavy loads without exceeding weight limits. Routes are restricted by daily distance limits (L) to prevent driver fatigue. Starting from the depot, crews first supply materials, then collect debris, ending at the depot for waste disposal—ensuring compliance with site schedules and safety protocols.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are time window constraints (TW) for deliveries and pickups at each site. Secondly, the trucks must handle backhaul demands (B) for waste pickup after completing linehaul deliveries. Additionally, there are distance limits (L) for the routes to prevent driver fatigue. The trucks start and end at the depot, so it is not an open route (O). The backhaul demands are only satisfied after all linehaul demands are met, which is characteristic of the 'B' (backhaul) variant rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 72
Description: A home appliance retailer offers a service to upgrade customers’ appliances (e.g., refrigerators, ovens) while recycling their old units. Delivery trucks must carry both new appliances (linehaul) and collect old appliances (backhaul) without exceeding vehicle capacity. Customers specify time windows for service (e.g., weekend availability), and routes can mix deliveries and pickups in any sequence. The goal is to minimize travel distance while ensuring all customers receive their new appliances and old units are retrieved for recycling promptly.
Reason: The problem description includes mixed backhaul (MB) where both new appliances (linehaul) and old appliances (backhaul) can be carried and collected in any sequence, time windows (TW) for customer service, and vehicle capacity constraints (C). Since 'MB' and 'TW' are present, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBTW' which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows.

Description: A security provider deploys equipment (linehaul) to event venues before setup deadlines (TW) and retrieves gear (backhaul) after the event concludes (TW). Vehicles (C) must carry bulky equipment efficiently. Routes are constrained by distance limits (L) to ensure rapid deployment. Drivers start at the depot, deliver gear, then collect it afterward, ending at the depot for storage—avoiding extra trips to optimize resource use.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul (B), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). Additionally, the vehicles must return to the depot, so it is not an open route (O is not present). The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, so it is not mixed backhaul (MB is not present). Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 8
Description: A sustainable logistics firm operates a closed-loop system: collecting organic waste from residential areas (<demand_backhaul>) and delivering compost (<demand_linehaul>) to urban farms. Vehicles start at a processing facility (<loc_depot>), alternating between pickups and drop-offs along their routes. Capacity (<capacity> tons) must balance the weight of waste and compost, with no return to the depot after completing all stops. The aim is to design routes that maximize efficiency, reduce emissions, and ensure no truck exceeds its weight limit.
Reason: The problem description involves a closed-loop system with backhaul (collecting organic waste) and linehaul (delivering compost) demands, and the vehicles do not return to the depot after completing all stops (open route). Additionally, there is a capacity constraint on the vehicles. The backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature. The 'O' (open route) feature is also present. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPB' (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul).

Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPTW, Index: 71
Description: A company specializes in providing temporary office spaces for events, conferences, and pop-up businesses. They need to deploy desks, chairs, and equipment to event locations and later dismantle them for reuse. Each vehicle has a capacity constraint for transporting bulky items. Deliveries and pickups can be scheduled in any order, depending on event timelines. Locations have strict time windows for setup (e.g., before a conference starts) and teardown (e.g., after an event concludes). Vehicles begin at a central warehouse and end their routes at the last customer, avoiding unnecessary return trips.
Reason: The problem involves capacity constraints (C), time windows for setup and teardown (TW), and open routes where vehicles do not return to the depot (O). Among the given variants, 'OVRPTW' is the most specific as it includes both open routes and time window constraints, which are the most relevant features in the problem description. The capacity constraint is implied but secondary to the open route and time window constraints.

Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 31
Description: A winery distributes wine bottles to distributors (linehaul) and collects grape waste from vineyards (backhaul). Deliveries to retailers must occur before regional wine festivals (time windows), while grape collection aligns with harvest schedules. Trucks must balance the weight of glass bottles (linehaul) and organic waste (backhaul) without exceeding <capacity> tons. A route might involve dropping off bottles to a downtown store (by noon) then immediately collecting pruned vines from a vineyard (before sunset) to meet composting deadlines.
Reason: The problem description involves both linehaul (delivering wine bottles) and backhaul (collecting grape waste), with time windows for deliveries and collections. The backhaul can be performed immediately after linehaul deliveries, indicating a mixed backhaul scenario. Additionally, there are time window constraints for both linehaul and backhaul tasks. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Load (capacity), and Time Windows.

To comply with maritime regulations, each voyage must not exceed a maximum travel distance (<distance_limit>), ensuring researchers and crew stay within safety and environmental guidelines.
Reason: The problem description includes open-ended routes (O), backhaul demand (B), and distance limits (L). The backhaul demand can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which is characteristic of 'B' rather than 'MB'. There are no time window constraints mentioned, so 'TW' is not included. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 7
Description: An electronics retailer operates a “trade-in” program where customers receive new devices (linehaul) and return old electronics (backhaul). Trucks depart from the warehouse at <loc_depot> to <num_customer> locations (<loc_customer>), each with a specified new-product demand (<demand_linehaul>) and e-waste pickup volume (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles must adhere to a <capacity> kg weight limit and cannot travel more than <distance_limit> km per route to avoid overnight storage. The retailer prioritizes minimizing total distance while allowing flexible stop sequences.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) where old electronics are picked up after delivering new devices, distance limits (L) for the vehicles, and there is no mention of time windows (TW) or the requirement for vehicles to return to the depot (O).

Description: A space agency must deliver sensitive satellite components to remote launch pads using specialized trucks. Each pad’s location is in <locs>, with demands <demand> (component weight). Launch windows <time_windows> are dictated by orbital mechanics, allowing only narrow timeframes for delivery. Service time <service_time> includes secure unloading. Trucks have a capacity <capacity> constrained by weight and vibration tolerance. The goal is to minimize travel distance while ensuring components arrive within celestial-aligned time windows.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints ('TW') for deliveries dictated by launch windows, and there is no mention of the vehicles needing to return to the depot, which suggests an open route ('O'). Additionally, there is no mention of backhaul demands ('B'), distance limits ('L'), or mixed backhaul ('MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPTW', which combines open routes with time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 70
Description: A veterinary service operates in remote farming regions, requiring trucks to deliver vaccines and medications to livestock farms while also collecting blood/silage samples from animals for lab testing. Each farm has strict operating hours (time windows) for health inspections, and the truck must balance the weight of perishable medical supplies (linehaul) with the volume of biological samples (backhaul). Vehicles must ensure temperature-sensitive medications are delivered before their expiration windows while adhering to farm-specific service times.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering vaccines and medications) and backhaul (collecting blood/silage samples) demands, which must be balanced. Additionally, there are strict time windows for farm visits, and the vehicles must adhere to these time constraints. The problem does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, suggesting an open route. The most specific variant that captures all these aspects is 'OVRPMBTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 31
Description: A rental company supplies temporary equipment (stages, lighting rigs, audio systems) to venues for live events. Trucks depart from a warehouse (<loc_depot>) and must deliver gear to event sites (<demand_linehaul>) before setup deadlines (<time_windows>). After events conclude, the same vehicles collect used equipment (<demand_backhaul>) within post-event pickup windows. Capacity constraints (<capacity>) require balancing heavy deliveries and bulky returns. Routes are planned to maximize efficiency, allowing drivers to end their shifts at the last pickup location without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), time windows (TW), and open routes (O) where vehicles do not return to the depot. Additionally, there are capacity constraints (C), but these are ignored when other features are present. The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 43
Description: A fitness equipment rental service delivers treadmills, weights, and gym gear to customers’ homes and retrieves used or expired equipment for recycling. Each delivery van (<capacity>) must account for both outbound rentals (linehaul) and inbound pickups (backhaul) without overloading. Routes are designed to optimize geographic proximity, allowing drivers to alternate between dropping off new equipment and collecting old items. The vehicles conclude their routes at the last customer location (<loc_customer>), reducing operational costs by avoiding return trips to the warehouse (<loc_depot>).
Reason: The problem description involves backhaul demand (B) where used or expired equipment is collected after delivering new equipment, and the routes are open (O) as vehicles conclude their routes at the last customer location without returning to the warehouse. There is no mention of distance limits (L) or time window constraints (TW). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRPB' which combines open routes with backhaul demand.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 90
Description: A telemedicine network operates across rural clinics, requiring regular delivery of new medical devices and collection of outdated equipment. Each clinic has specific operational hours (<time_windows>), during which staff can receive deliveries or surrender old devices. Vehicles must carry a mix of outgoing supplies (<demand_linehaul>) and incoming returns (<demand_backhaul>), ensuring total load does not exceed capacity (<capacity>). For instance, a truck departing from the central medical hub (<loc_depot>) might first deliver a telehealth station to a clinic with morning availability, then collect outdated equipment from another clinic operating in the afternoon. Routes must respect strict clinic schedules to avoid delays in critical healthcare services.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), backhaul demand (<demand_backhaul>), and linehaul demand (<demand_linehaul>). The vehicles can carry both types of demand simultaneously (mixed backhaul), and there is no mention of vehicles having to return to the depot, suggesting an open route. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW', which includes open routes (O), mixed backhaul (MB), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW).

Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 58
Description: A port logistics company supplies cruise ships with perishable food and supplies (deliveries) and collects garbage and recyclables from ships (pickups) during their brief docking periods. Each ship has time windows for loading/unloading, and the port’s limited operating hours impose a strict distance limit on vessel routes. Trucks must balance the weight of provisions and waste within their capacity while coordinating with the ship’s schedule to avoid delays.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple constraints and features that align with specific VRP variants. The presence of both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) suggests a backhaul component. The description mentions that trucks must balance the weight of provisions and waste within their capacity, indicating a capacity constraint. The port’s limited operating hours impose a strict distance limit on vessel routes, which corresponds to a distance limit constraint. Additionally, each ship has time windows for loading/unloading, which introduces time window constraints. The problem does not explicitly mention that vehicles must return to the depot, but it does not state that they do not have to return either, so we assume a closed route (not 'O'). Given these features, the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW', which includes backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 83
Description: During natural disasters, relief teams deliver food, medical kits, and bedding (linehaul) to emergency shelters within strict time windows to align with evacuation schedules. They also collect hazardous waste and non-functional supplies (backhaul) for safe disposal. Vehicles must not exceed weight limits while carrying mixed cargo and must return to the depot before fuel runs out (distance limit). The priority is ensuring shelters receive critical resources on time while managing waste removal without overextending drivers.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, there are time window constraints ('TW') for delivering resources to shelters. Secondly, there is a backhaul component ('B') where hazardous waste and non-functional supplies are collected after delivering the linehaul. Thirdly, vehicles must return to the depot before fuel runs out, indicating a distance limit ('L'). Additionally, the backhaul is only collected after all linehaul deliveries are completed, which is characteristic of a standard backhaul ('B') rather than a mixed backhaul ('MB'). The vehicles must return to the depot, so it is not an open route ('O' is not applicable). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: CVRP, Predicted: OVRP, Index: 61
Description: An energy logistics firm supplies offshore oil drilling platforms with equipment, tools, and maintenance parts. Starting from a coastal depot <loc_depot>, supply vessels must distribute critical cargo to <num_customer> rigs located in distant oceanic regions. Each vessel has a <capacity> ton payload limit, forcing planners to balance load distribution across routes. The challenge lies in ensuring all rigs receive their required supplies (<demand>) without exceeding vessel capacities.
Reason: The problem description mentions that supply vessels must distribute cargo to rigs without any mention of returning to the depot, which suggests an open route (O). Additionally, there is a capacity constraint (C) for the vessels, but since 'O' is present, 'C' is ignored. There is no mention of backhaul (B), distance limits (L), or time windows (TW) in the description. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRP'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 71
Description: An EV charging network operates battery-swap stations across a city. Trucks must replenish stations with fully charged batteries (linehaul) and collect depleted ones (backhaul) for recharging. Each station has time windows for peak demand periods (e.g., morning commutes), and the trucks must balance the weight of heavy batteries without exceeding vehicle capacity. The routes must synchronize with station operational schedules to avoid service disruptions.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), time windows (TW), and the need to balance the weight of heavy batteries without exceeding vehicle capacity (C). However, since 'B' and 'TW' are present, 'C' is ignored. The description does not mention distance limits (L) or open routes (O), and it implies that backhaul and linehaul demands are not mixed (i.e., backhaul is only after linehaul is satisfied), so 'MB' is not applicable. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 46
Description: A company specializes in setting up and dismantling temporary stages, lighting systems, and seating for large outdoor events. Their trucks (<capacity> ton capacity) must deliver equipment to event sites (<loc_customer>) and later retrieve it for reuse. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius of the central warehouse (<loc_depot>) to comply with contractual time limits. The mixed backhaul flexibility lets drivers interleave deliveries and pickups (e.g., drop off stage components at one site, then pick up dismantled tents from another) to optimize efficiency without overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) where deliveries and pickups can be interleaved, distance limits (L) as routes must stay within a certain radius, and the vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot immediately after each trip (O). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBL' which includes open routes (O), mixed backhaul (MB), and distance limits (L).

Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 80
Description: A marine research organization must deploy scientific equipment to coastal observation stations (deliveries) and simultaneously collect biological samples from remote locations (pickups). Each station has strict time windows for equipment setup to coincide with tidal conditions, while sample pickups must occur within 4 hours of collection to preserve specimen viability. Vehicles carry a mix of fragile equipment and perishable samples, constrained by a <capacity> kg payload. Routes must optimize travel to service all sites without returning to the research vessel’s base port after the final stop.
Reason: The problem involves both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) with no requirement to return to the depot (open route), strict time windows for deliveries, and a capacity constraint. The pickups and deliveries can occur in any order (mixed backhaul), and there are time window constraints. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPMBLTW', which includes open routes, mixed backhaul, capacity constraints, and time windows.

Description: A telecommunications provider must rapidly deploy temporary cell towers to disaster-affected regions to restore connectivity. Each site has a critical time window for installation to meet urgent demands. After the crisis, towers must be retrieved and returned to the depot. Vehicles must first deliver equipment (linehaul) within setup time windows, then later collect the towers (backhaul), ensuring deliveries precede pickups. Route planning must respect vehicle capacities and strict timelines to avoid overloading while minimizing travel distance.
Reason: The problem description involves both linehaul and backhaul demands with the condition that deliveries must precede pickups (B), time window constraints for installation (TW), and vehicle capacity constraints (C). Although the vehicles must return to the depot after collections, the problem does not specify open routes (O) or distance limits (L). The most specific variant that captures all these elements is 'VRPBTW', which includes backhaul demands and time windows.

Description: A textbook distributor must deliver new textbooks to schools (linehaul) and collect used textbooks for recycling (backhaul). Each school has strict time windows aligned with academic schedules, such as the start of the semester or specific class hours. Delivery trucks must not exceed their capacity while carrying both new and returned books. Routes must also stay within a maximum distance to ensure drivers return before shift end, avoiding overnight stays. The goal is to minimize total distance while respecting school schedules, textbook capacity limits, and driver working hours.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and time window constraints (TW). The backhaul demand is specified to be collected after all linehaul deliveries are completed, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). The vehicles must return to the depot (not open route), and there are strict time windows for deliveries and pickups. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW', which includes backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: A luxury wine auction house must deliver fragile, high-value vintage bottles from a storage facility (<loc_depot>) to international auction venues (<loc_customer>). Each venue has a strict unloading time window (<time_windows>) to match auction setup schedules. Refrigerated trucks have a limited capacity (<capacity> bottles) to prevent overcrowding, and routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km range to avoid overheating the cargo. The challenge is to prioritize deliveries without exceeding vehicle limits or missing deadlines for prestigious events.
Reason: The problem description includes several key constraints: time windows (<time_windows>), distance limits (<distance_limit>), and vehicle capacity (<capacity>). The presence of time windows and distance limits suggests the need for 'TW' and 'L' in the variant. Additionally, the problem does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, which implies an open route ('O'). There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul demands, so 'B' and 'MB' are not relevant here. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these constraints is 'OVRPLTW'.

Description: An oil drilling company must supply remote offshore platforms with equipment and personnel while removing toxic waste for safe disposal. Helicopters and supply boats (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a coastal terminal (<loc_depot>), serving <num_customer> rigs (<loc_customer>). Each rig’s schedule includes strict crew shift windows (<time_windows>) for deliveries and pickup times for waste containers. Vehicles must complete their missions within a <distance_limit> nautical mile limit to ensure return before adverse weather. Crews can interleave supply drops and waste collection in any sequence, but must account for fluctuating rig accessibility due to tides and drilling operations.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there are time window constraints (<time_windows>) for deliveries and pickups, which corresponds to 'TW'. Second, the vehicles have a distance limit (<distance_limit>), which corresponds to 'L'. Third, the problem involves both delivering supplies (linehaul) and picking up waste (backhaul), and these operations can be interleaved in any sequence, which corresponds to 'MB' (mixed backhaul). The vehicles must return to the depot, so it is not an open route ('O' is not applicable). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBLTW', which includes mixed backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.

Description: A company operates a network of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across a city. Technicians must deliver replacement parts to malfunctioning stations (deliveries) and collect depleted batteries from stations for recycling (pickups). Each service vehicle has a capacity limit for carrying parts and batteries. Stations require maintenance during off-peak hours (time windows), and routes must not exceed a maximum distance to ensure technicians return before their shift ends. The goal is to optimize routes to service all stations efficiently while respecting time constraints and capacity limits.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple constraints and features: capacity limits (C), backhaul demand (B) for collecting depleted batteries, distance limits (L) to ensure technicians return before their shift ends, and time window constraints (TW) for maintenance during off-peak hours. Since the problem involves backhaul demand that can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand (deliveries) is satisfied, and it includes distance limits and time windows, the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW'.

Description: A clothing retailer’s distribution team must restock regional stores with new inventory (<demand_linehaul>) while collecting returned garments (<demand_backhaul>). Trucks begin at the central warehouse (<loc_depot>), visit stores in any order to drop off fresh stock and pick up returns. Each truck’s capacity (<capacity> cubic meters) must account for both outgoing and incoming items. Routes terminate at the final store, prioritizing minimal travel distance while adhering to load limits. The solution ensures efficient use of space and avoids costly overloads.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering new inventory) and backhaul (collecting returned garments) demands, which can be satisfied in any order (not strictly after all linehaul is done, as implied by 'B'). The routes terminate at the final store (open route, 'O'), and there are capacity constraints ('C'). There is no mention of distance limits ('L') or time windows ('TW'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPB' (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls).

Description: A bike-sharing service must rebalance bicycles across high-demand zones (<loc_customer>) while collecting damaged bikes for repairs. Electric vehicles (<capacity>) start at the central depot (<loc_depot>) and redistribute bikes to stations needing replenishment while picking up broken units. Routes must finish at the farthest station to avoid empty return trips. Daily distance limits (<distance_limit>) ensure drivers don’t overwork, and stations have time windows (<time_windows>) for staff availability to process exchanges.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. Firstly, the vehicles do not return to the depot, which corresponds to 'O' (open route). Secondly, there is a backhaul demand (collecting damaged bikes) which can only be satisfied after the linehaul demand (redistributing bikes) is met, corresponding to 'B'. Additionally, there are distance limits ('L') and time windows ('TW') for the stations. Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW'.

Description: Airport ground crews must deliver baggage to departing flights (linehaul) and collect catering equipment from arriving aircraft (backhaul). Each gate has time windows (TW) tied to flight schedules. Vehicles must not exceed capacity (C) for combined loads, operate within terminal proximity (L), and conclude routes at the last gate served (O).
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (TW), backhaul (B), distance limits (L), and open routes (O). The backhaul is described as collecting catering equipment from arriving aircraft after delivering baggage to departing flights, which fits the backhaul (B) definition where backhaul demand is satisfied only after linehaul demand. The vehicles must operate within terminal proximity, indicating distance limits (L). The routes conclude at the last gate served, indicating open routes (O). Time windows (TW) are explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW' which includes backhaul, distance limits, and time windows, and assumes closed routes (since 'O' is not included in the variant name, but the description mentions open routes, which might suggest 'OVRPBLTW' is more accurate. However, 'VRPBLTW' is the closest match in the provided list that includes all the mentioned constraints except 'O'.

Description: A coastal environmental agency uses research vessels to deploy scientific instruments (linehaul) to <num_customer> marine monitoring stations (<loc_customer>) and later collect plastic waste (backhaul) from polluted beaches. Each vessel has a <capacity> ton capacity for equipment and waste. The equipment deployment phase must occur before waste collection to avoid contamination of scientific gear. Vessels must also adhere to a <distance_limit> nautical mile limit to ensure safe return to the base port (<loc_depot>) without refueling. The challenge is optimizing routes to cover all stations and cleanup sites efficiently while balancing cargo weight and avoiding overreach of travel limits.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met, distance limits (L) for the vessels, and the requirement to return to the depot (not open route). There are no mentions of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB). Therefore, the most appropriate variant is VRPBL, which combines backhaul and distance constraints.

Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 76
Description: A utility company deploys new smart meters to residential neighborhoods while collecting outdated meters for recycling. Technicians must first deliver new meters (linehaul) within homeowners’ scheduled time windows, then return to retrieve the old units (backhaul). Each van’s capacity restricts the number of meters it can carry. Routes are capped at a distance limit to ensure timely service, with all installations finalized before the next billing cycle and pickups completed within a week.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there are time window constraints (TW) for delivering new meters. Second, there is a backhaul demand (B) where old meters are collected after all new meters are delivered. Third, there is a distance limit (L) for the routes. Additionally, the problem does not mention that vehicles must return to the depot, but it also does not explicitly state that they do not, so we assume they do (not 'O'). The backhaul is sequential (not mixed, so not 'MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'VRPBLTW'.

Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 66
Description: A film production company requires trucks to transport camera gear, lighting rigs, and props to multiple shooting locations. After filming concludes, the same vehicles collect all equipment and discarded set materials (e.g., unused props, temporary structures). Routes must balance delivery and pickup tasks without overloading trucks, ending at the last site visited to optimize fuel and labor costs.
Reason: The problem involves both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) tasks, which must be balanced without overloading trucks. This matches the 'B' (backhaul) feature, where backhaul demand can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is met. Additionally, the vehicles do not need to return to the depot after the last site, indicating an 'O' (open route) feature. There is no mention of distance limits ('L') or time windows ('TW'), so these are not considered. Thus, the most specific variant is 'OVRPB' (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul).

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 35
Description: A feed supplier must deliver fresh livestock feed to farms and collect manure waste for composting. Each farm has a strict delivery time window (e.g., before morning feeding) and a later pickup window for waste collection. Vehicles must first complete all feed deliveries (linehaul) before returning to collect manure (backhaul). Trucks are limited by their capacity to carry both feed and manure without exceeding weight limits. Routes end at the final pickup location, avoiding unnecessary return trips to the depot.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that align with specific VRP variants. First, there are strict delivery and pickup time windows (TW) for each farm. Second, the vehicles must complete all feed deliveries (linehaul) before collecting manure (backhaul, B). Third, the routes end at the final pickup location, indicating open routes (O) where vehicles do not return to the depot. Additionally, there is a capacity constraint (C) for carrying both feed and manure, but this is secondary to the other features. Combining these features, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBLTW', which includes open routes, backhaul demands, distance limits (implied by capacity constraints), and time windows.

Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 82
Description: A maritime logistics company supplies offshore oil platforms with machinery parts, safety gear, and food (linehaul) while collecting hazardous waste and used equipment (backhaul). Each boat has a limited cargo capacity and must stay within a distance limit to ensure safe operation without refueling. Routes conclude at the final platform visited, and the order of deliveries and pickups can be adjusted to manage weight distribution efficiently.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and open routes (O) where vehicles do not return to the depot. Additionally, the backhaul demand can be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is satisfied, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). There is no mention of time window constraints (TW), so that feature is not included. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'OVRPBL'.

Description: A film production company is shooting in rugged mountainous terrain. Each day, trucks must deliver cameras, lighting rigs, and set props (<demand_linehaul>) to filming locations (<loc_customer>). After setup, they collect used props, discarded materials, and equipment for reuse or disposal (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have a limited capacity (<capacity>) to handle both deliveries and pickups. The mountainous roads impose a strict distance limit (<distance_limit>) on routes to prevent exceeding fuel reserves, as the nearest refueling station is hours away. The goal is to optimize routes so crews receive everything needed while efficiently repatriating waste without overloading trucks or straying beyond safe travel distances.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B), distance limits (L), and does not mention any requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, suggesting an open route (O). There is no mention of time window constraints (TW), so they are not considered. The most specific variant that matches these features is 'OVRPBL', which combines open routes with backhaul demand and distance limits.

Description: A construction company needs to supply materials like steel beams and cement to active building sites (<loc_customer>) while also collecting recyclable waste (e.g., scrap metal) from those same sites. Trucks depart from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>) with a maximum capacity (<capacity> tons) and must manage both deliveries and pickups in any sequence. Each site has strict access windows (<time_windows>) enforced by city regulations, requiring trucks to arrive precisely when work is ongoing. The goal is to minimize total mileage while ensuring no truck exceeds its weight limit and all materials are delivered/picked up within operational hours.
Reason: The problem description includes multiple features that need to be considered: 1) capacity constraints (<capacity> tons), 2) mixed backhaul (both deliveries and pickups can be done in any sequence, not strictly linehaul first), 3) time windows (<time_windows> for site access). The presence of mixed backhaul (MB) and time windows (TW) are the most specific features, overriding the basic capacity constraint (C). There is no mention of distance limits (L) or open routes (O), so these are not included. Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPMBTW'.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 94
Description: A retailer hosts temporary pop-up stores in urban centers, needing to deliver merchandise (linehaul) before event opening hours (<time_windows>) and collect unsold items (backhaul) after closing. Each delivery van (capacity <capacity>) must fully stock kiosks first, then retrieve excess inventory during teardown. Routes finish at a regional distribution center, bypassing the main warehouse to accelerate restocking for the next location. The challenge is balancing load limits while ensuring pop-ups open on time and excess goods are recovered efficiently, avoiding costly overstock or understock scenarios.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand (B) which can only be satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied, time window constraints (TW) for both delivery and collection, and the routes finish at a regional distribution center without returning to the main warehouse, indicating an open route (O). The most specific variant that captures all these features is 'OVRPBLTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 97
Description: A rescue team deploys emergency kits, medical supplies, and climbing gear to remote mountain shelters (linehaul) and later retrieves used equipment for maintenance. The vehicles must deliver critical supplies first, then collect returned gear. Each vehicle has a capacity limit, and routes must stay within a distance threshold to ensure rescuers can return safely without refueling. The goal is to service all shelters while minimizing total travel distance and respecting operational constraints.
Reason: The problem description involves delivering critical supplies (linehaul) first and then collecting returned gear (backhaul), which corresponds to 'B' (backhaul demand). Additionally, the vehicles have distance limits ('L') to ensure they can return safely without refueling. There is no mention of time windows ('TW') or open routes ('O'), and the backhaul must be satisfied only after all linehaul demand is met, which is characteristic of 'B' rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBL'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 97
Description: A catering company supplies food trucks with fresh ingredients (<demand_linehaul>) and collects reusable containers (<demand_backhaul>) from their locations. Each food truck operates within a specific time window (<time_windows>), and the delivery/pickup sequence must align with their service hours. Trucks have limited capacity (<capacity>) to carry both perishables and containers, and their routes must not exceed a daily distance limit (<distance_limit>) to ensure timely returns for restocking. The aim is to minimize travel costs while meeting all operational constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul demand ('B'), distance limits ('L'), and time windows ('TW'). Additionally, the backhaul demand is collected after delivering the linehaul demand, which aligns with the 'B' (backhaul) feature rather than 'MB' (mixed backhaul). The vehicles must return to the depot, so it is not an open route ('O'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBLTW', which combines all these features.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 99
Description: A university logistics team delivers scientific equipment, lab supplies, and chemicals to research facilities (linehaul) and collects expired or hazardous materials for disposal. Vehicles must first deliver items before retrieving waste. Each vehicle has a strict capacity limit, and routes must not exceed a predefined distance to avoid lengthy return trips. The goal is to plan routes that efficiently service all labs while adhering to safety and operational constraints.
Reason: The problem description involves delivering items before retrieving waste (backhaul demand), vehicles have strict capacity limits (capacity), and routes must not exceed a predefined distance (distance limits). There is no mention of time windows or open routes. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches these constraints is 'VRPBL', which includes backhaul demand and distance limits.

Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 45
Description: A renewable energy company must deliver new solar panels to residential sites and collect old panels for recycling. Each customer site has a time window aligned with the availability of installation crews. Vehicles must efficiently mix deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) in any route sequence, ensuring the total weight of panels (new + old) does not exceed truck capacity. Time windows are critical as crews can only work during specific hours, and solar panels degrade in viability if not installed promptly.
Reason: The problem description involves time windows (TW) for customer sites, mixed backhaul (MB) where both deliveries and pickups can occur in any sequence, and capacity constraints (C) on the total weight of panels. The most specific variant that includes all these features is 'VRPMBLTW', which stands for Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul, Load (capacity), and Time Windows. The 'O' (open route) is not mentioned as a requirement, so we do not include it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 97
Description: A city’s seasonal bike-sharing program delivers bikes and gear to parks before peak hours (within strict delivery time windows). Returned equipment is later collected. Vehicles must first deliver rentals (linehaul) to park locations within time slots, then return to retrieve items (backhaul), managing capacity to avoid overloading. Timely service ensures equipment availability for users while optimizing routes for efficiency.
Reason: The problem description involves delivering bikes to parks (linehaul) and then collecting returned equipment (backhaul), which indicates a backhaul demand ('B'). Additionally, the deliveries must be made within strict delivery time windows ('TW'). The vehicles must manage capacity to avoid overloading, but since 'B' and 'TW' are present, 'C' is ignored. There is no mention of distance limits ('L') or open routes ('O'), and the backhaul demand is only satisfied after all linehaul demand is satisfied (not mixed backhaul 'MB'). Therefore, the most specific variant is 'VRPBTW'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 70
Description: Museums worldwide loan priceless artifacts to temporary exhibitions, requiring precise logistics. Vehicles must transport fragile items from a central depot (<loc_depot>) to exhibition venues (<loc_customer>), each with specific time windows (<time_windows>) to align with installation schedules. Each truck has a limited cargo capacity (<capacity>) to protect artifacts from overcrowding, and routes must stay within a maximum distance (<distance_limit>) to prevent extended exposure to vibrations. The goal is to ensure artifacts arrive undamaged and on time while minimizing total travel distance.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>), distance limits (<distance_limit>), and capacity constraints (<capacity>). The vehicles do not necessarily have to return to the depot, which suggests an open route (O). Therefore, the most specific variant that matches all these features is 'OVRPLTW', which stands for Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Distance Limits and Time Windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 18
Description: A linen service company supplies fresh linens to hotels in a busy tourist area. Each truck carries a maximum of <capacity> linen bundles. Hotels demand deliveries during off-peak hours (<time_windows>) to avoid guest disruptions. Routes must also adhere to a daily distance limit (<distance_limit>), as the company operates in a mountainous region with limited fuel stations. The challenge is to balance efficiency, driver schedules, and hotel operational needs.
Reason: The problem description includes time window constraints (<time_windows>) for deliveries, a distance limit (<distance_limit>) due to mountainous terrain, and there is no mention of the vehicles needing to return to the depot, which suggests an open route (O). However, the description does not mention backhaul or mixed backhaul demands. Therefore, the most specific variant that matches the given constraints is the Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Distance Limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPBTW, Index: 75
Description: A sustainable agriculture startup delivers gardening tools, seeds, and soil to urban farms while collecting organic compost for recycling. Each delivery vehicle has a <capacity> ton capacity, balancing both outgoing equipment and incoming waste. Urban farms operate during specific hours (<time_windows>), requiring precise timing for deliveries and pickups. Routes must start from the central depot (<loc_depot>) but end at the last customer site, avoiding return trips. The goal is to optimize routes to minimize travel distance while adhering to time windows and ensuring no vehicle exceeds its capacity.
Reason: The problem description includes several key features that help identify the most specific variant. First, the routes must start from the central depot but end at the last customer site, avoiding return trips, which corresponds to the 'O' (open route) feature. Second, there is a backhaul demand (collecting organic compost) which can be satisfied only after delivering the outgoing equipment (gardening tools, seeds, and soil), corresponding to the 'B' (backhaul) feature. Third, urban farms operate during specific hours, requiring precise timing for deliveries and pickups, which corresponds to the 'TW' (time window) feature. The problem does not mention any distance limits for the vehicles, so the 'L' feature is not applicable. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is 'OVRPBTW', which combines open routes, backhaul demands, and time window constraints.
