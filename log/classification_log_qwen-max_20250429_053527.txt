Description: A factory assembles <num_jobs> PCBs using <num_machines> machines for soldering, component placement, testing, and packaging. The assembly sequence is flexible, as long as all steps are completed for each PCB. Processing times for each stage are given in <processing_times>. The scheduler must assign tasks to machines while ensuring no overlaps, aiming to minimize the total production time.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the factory assembles PCBs using multiple machines for soldering, component placement, testing, and packaging, with a flexible assembly sequence. This means that while each job (PCB) must go through all stages, there is flexibility in choosing which machine to use for each operation, but it does not specify a completely open order of operations or a specific precedence constraint beyond the need to complete all steps. The goal is to minimize total production time without overlapping tasks on the same machine. These characteristics closely match the definition of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where there is a predefined set of operations for each job, but the choice of machine for each operation can be flexible.

Description: A PCB factory assembles <num_jobs> circuit board orders through sequential stages (e.g., solder paste application, component placement, reflow soldering, testing) on <num_machines> dedicated machines. Each stage is permanently assigned to a machine with fixed durations in <processing_times>. Machines process one stage at a time, and orders must follow their assembly sequence strictly. The objective is to minimize total production time by optimizing the schedule while adhering to precision manufacturing tolerances.
Reason: The problem description specifies that each stage of the circuit board assembly is permanently assigned to a dedicated machine, and all jobs (circuit board orders) must follow the same sequence of stages. This aligns with the definition of the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP), where all jobs go through the same set of machines in the same order. The objective to minimize total production time by optimizing the schedule, while maintaining the strict sequence for each job, is a characteristic feature of FSSP.

Description: A luxury perfumery processes <num_jobs> custom fragrance orders through <num_machines> stages (essential oil mixing, alcohol infusion, aging, and bottling). The order of stages is flexible to accommodate ingredient prep times. Each stage’s duration is defined in <processing_times>, and only one batch can occupy a workstation at a time. The goal is to minimize the total production time for all orders.
Reason: The problem describes a scenario where there are multiple stages (essential oil mixing, alcohol infusion, aging, and bottling) with the flexibility to change the order of these stages. Each stage can be seen as an operation that needs to be completed for each job (custom fragrance order). Since the order of operations is flexible, this does not fit into the classic JSSP or FSSP models, which require a fixed sequence of operations. The presence of multiple stages but without mentioning parallel machines in any stage excludes HFSSP. The ASP is not suitable as it implies a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of precedence constraints, which is not indicated here. The OSSP, which allows for no predefined order among operations, closely matches the given conditions. However, the most fitting model, considering the flexibility in the sequence of operations and the need to process jobs through several distinct stages, is the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), as it accommodates the variability in the sequence of operations while still requiring all operations to be performed for each job.

Description: A logistics company operates <num_jobs> delivery drones that require recharging, battery diagnostics, and software updates across <num_machines> service stations. The sequence of maintenance tasks is flexible, allowing the scheduler to optimize for minimal downtime. Each task duration is specified in <processing_times>, and no station can service more than one drone simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total time needed to prepare the entire fleet for redeployment.
Reason: The problem involves multiple drones (jobs) that need to undergo a series of maintenance tasks (operations) at different service stations (machines). The sequence of these tasks is flexible, and the aim is to minimize the makespan. This matches the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where operations for each job can be processed on any of the available machines, but there is a predefined order for the operations themselves.

Label: JSSP, Predicted: FSSP, Index: 31
Description: A pharmaceutical plant handles <num_jobs> vaccine batches through sterile sequential stages (e.g., vial filling, lyophilization, capping, labeling) on <num_machines> isolator-protected machines. Each stage is irrevocably tied to a contamination-controlled machine with fixed timings in <processing_times>. Machines process one batch at a time, and batches must follow regulatory-approved sequences without overlap. The objective is to minimize total production time while adhering to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) constraints.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each vaccine batch must go through a set of sterile sequential stages, and each stage is irrevocably tied to a specific machine. This setup implies a fixed sequence of operations for all jobs (vaccine batches) with no flexibility in the choice of machines for each operation, which aligns with the characteristics of the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP). Additionally, the objective to minimize total production time while adhering to GMP constraints fits well within the FSSP framework, where the goal is often to optimize the makespan or total completion time.

Description: A boutique bicycle shop assembles <num_jobs> custom orders, each requiring work at <num_machines> specialized stations (frame welding, gear tuning, paint finishing, and quality testing). The order of operations is adaptable to reduce bottlenecks. Task durations are listed in <processing_times>, and each station can only process one bike at a time. The scheduler aims to minimize the total workshop time to fulfill all orders.
Reason: The problem describes a scenario where each custom bicycle order (job) needs to go through multiple specialized stations (machines), and the order of operations can be adapted, which indicates flexibility in both the machine choice and the sequence of operations. This aligns with the definition of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where there is flexibility in selecting machines for each operation and the sequence of operations can be adjusted. The goal of minimizing the total workshop time to fulfill all orders is also consistent with the objectives typically found in FJSSP scenarios.

Description: A disaster response team must deploy <num_jobs> mobile field hospitals, each requiring <num_machines> modular units (triage, surgery, recovery, sterilization). The setup order is adaptable based on terrain and urgency. Unit assembly times vary per hospital (see <processing_times>), and each unit can only handle one hospital at a time. The objective is to minimize the total deployment time to maximize lifesaving capacity.
Reason: The problem involves deploying multiple mobile field hospitals, each requiring a set of modular units (triage, surgery, recovery, sterilization) with varying assembly times. The setup order can be adapted based on terrain and urgency, indicating flexibility in the sequence of operations. However, since there is a specific set of required units for each hospital and these units have to follow a logical order (preprocessing, treatment, post-treatment), it fits into an Assembly Scheduling Problem (ASP) where operations have precedence constraints forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This means not only the order but also the dependencies between different types of units need to be considered, making ASP the most suitable variant.

Description: A cosmetics facility packages <num_jobs> batches of organic face cream through <num_machines> hygienic stations: sterile filling, pump attachment, labeling, and shrink-wrapping. Each batch’s sequence is immutable, with processing times per machine in <processing_times>. Parallel processing is prohibited to avoid contamination. The goal is to minimize total packaging time for perishable ingredients.
Reason: The problem describes a scenario where each batch (job) of organic face cream must go through a specific sequence of operations (sterile filling, pump attachment, labeling, and shrink-wrapping) at hygienic stations (machines), with each operation being performed by a designated machine. There is no flexibility in the choice of machines for performing an operation, and there is a fixed order in which these operations must be completed. Parallel processing is not allowed to prevent contamination, indicating that each job follows its own predefined route without the possibility of choosing different machines for the same task. This directly aligns with the characteristics of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

Description: An artisanal candle workshop produces <num_jobs> decorative candles via <num_machines> steps: wax melting, dye mixing, embedding dried flowers, cooling, and packaging. Each candle undergoes these operations in sequence, with exclusive machine access. The fixed processing times are provided in <processing_times>. The schedule aims to minimize the total production time for the entire batch.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each candle (job) goes through a fixed sequence of operations (wax melting, dye mixing, embedding dried flowers, cooling, and packaging) on exclusive machines. This matches the characteristics of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), where there is a predefined order of operations for each job, and each operation is performed by a specific machine.

Description: A boutique workshop customizes <num_jobs> bicycles through <num_machines> stages like frame welding, paintwork, and component assembly. The operation sequence is flexible to accommodate artisan workflows and material availability. Task times (see <processing_times>) depend on design complexity, and each machine handles one bike at a time. The objective is to minimize the makespan while ensuring premium craftsmanship.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the operation sequence is flexible, which means there is no strict predefined order for the operations. This flexibility in choosing the order of operations points towards a variant that allows for such variability. The "FJSSP" (Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem) fits this scenario well as it not only allows for the choice of machines per operation but also assumes a certain level of flexibility in the operation sequence to accommodate different workflows and material availability. However, since the core requirement is about the flexibility in operation sequences rather than the choice of machines (which is also present but not emphasized), the "OSSP" (Open Shop Scheduling Problem) might seem like a closer match because it specifically deals with scenarios where there is no predefined order for the operations. But, considering the context of the bicycle customization process involving specific stages (frame welding, paintwork, and component assembly), "FJSSP" more accurately reflects the situation by allowing both machine and operational flexibility while still recognizing the existence of distinct stages.

Description: An auto repair shop must service <num_jobs> vehicles, each requiring work on <num_machines> stations such as diagnostics, tire replacement, oil change, and detailing. The order of servicing is flexible, allowing mechanics to optimize workflow based on station availability. Each task has a fixed duration (see <processing_times>), and no station or vehicle can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total time needed to complete all repairs.
Reason: The problem describes a scenario where there are multiple vehicles (jobs) that need to be serviced at different stations (machines), and the order of servicing (operations) is flexible based on station availability. Each task has a fixed duration, and no station or vehicle can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the makespan. This matches the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) because it allows for the choice of which machine (station) performs each operation (task) and does not strictly define an operation order, fitting the flexibility in the workflow optimization as described.

Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 43
Description: A convention center must prepare <num_jobs> conference rooms for events requiring <num_machines> setup tasks (e.g., audio-visual testing, seating arrangement, signage, and catering). The order of tasks is flexible, but each has fixed times (<processing_times>). Only one team can work in a room at a time, and each setup task requires dedicated equipment. The goal is to minimize the total setup time before sessions begin.
Reason: The problem described involves multiple tasks (setup tasks) that need to be completed in conference rooms, with the order of these tasks being flexible. Each task has a fixed duration and requires dedicated equipment, meaning that while the specific machine (or in this case, the team and their equipment) for each task is not necessarily fixed, there is a requirement for dedicated resources. Since the sequence of tasks can vary, but they all need to be completed before sessions begin, and considering the nature of the setup tasks where only one team can work in a room at a time, this scenario best fits the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), as it allows for flexibility in the choice of "machines" (teams/equipment) per operation (task) without a strictly predefined order.

Description: A post-production studio processes <num_jobs> film projects through <num_machines> workstations for editing, color grading, sound mixing, and VFX. The order of processing is adaptable to resource availability, with each task duration specified in <processing_times>. Only one project can occupy a workstation at a time. The objective is to minimize the makespan—the time until all films are finalized.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the post-production studio can adapt the order of processing tasks based on resource availability, which implies a flexible choice in terms of both the machine and the sequence of operations for each film project. Since there is no strict requirement for all jobs to follow the same sequence or for a fixed machine per operation, and given the flexibility in choosing the order of tasks, the most suitable variant is FJSSP, as it allows for flexible machine choices while still maintaining a predefined but adaptable operation order for each job.

Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 35
Description: A tech manufacturer assembles <num_jobs> customized smartphones using <num_machines> workstations (e.g., screen installation, battery fitting, camera calibration, and software flashing). The assembly sequence for each phone is flexible, allowing optimization based on workstation availability. Each operation’s duration is specified in <processing_times>, and no workstation can handle more than one phone at a time. The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total time to assemble all phones.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the assembly sequence for each phone is flexible, allowing optimization based on workstation availability. This suggests that while there are specific operations (such as screen installation, battery fitting, etc.) to be performed, the order of these operations can be adjusted, and not all workstations are required to perform every operation. There is no strict requirement for a fixed machine per operation or a predefined sequence of operations that must be followed by all phones, which rules out JSSP, FSSP, HFSSP, and ASP. OSSP is too open-ended as it does not have any precedence constraints, which this problem implies through its defined set of operations. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is FJSSP, as it allows for flexibility in choosing which workstation performs an operation and still requires a predefined sequence of operations to be completed for each phone.

Description: A tech firm deploys <num_jobs> smart home setups, each requiring installations of security systems, lighting controls, HVAC automation, and audio-visual components across <num_machines> technician teams. The installation order for each home is flexible, but all tasks must be completed. Task durations per home (e.g., 2 hours for lighting, 3 for HVAC) are listed in <processing_times>. The scheduler aims to minimize the makespan—the time until the last home is fully operational.
Reason: The problem description indicates that there are multiple tasks (security systems, lighting controls, HVAC automation, and audio-visual components) to be completed for each smart home setup. The installation order for these tasks is flexible, meaning there is no strict sequence in which the tasks must be performed, but all tasks need to be completed for each home. Since the operation order is not fixed and there is flexibility in how the technician teams (machines) can be assigned to the tasks, this scenario best fits the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). The goal of minimizing the makespan, or the total time until all homes are fully operational, aligns with the objective in FJSSP.

Description: A temporary clinic administers vaccines to <num_jobs> patients through <num_machines> stations: registration, medical screening, injection, and post-vaccination monitoring. The order of stations can vary (e.g., screening before or after registration) to reduce bottlenecks. Each station’s service time is in <processing_times>, with no parallel processing per station. The objective is to minimize total clinic operation time while serving all patients.
Reason: The problem describes a scenario where patients (jobs) go through a series of stations (machines) with the flexibility to change the order of some stations, aiming to minimize the total operation time. Since there is no strict requirement for all jobs to follow the exact same sequence and the order of operations can vary to reduce bottlenecks, this fits best with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), which allows for flexible machine choice per operation and has a predefined, but potentially adjustable, operation order.

Description: An NGO coordinates <num_jobs> meal batches for disaster survivors, requiring cooking, packaging, and quality checks across <num_machines> portable stations. The order of stages can vary (e.g., packaging may occur before final heating). Each step’s duration is listed in <processing_times>, with constraints on parallel processing. The goal is to minimize the total time to deliver all meals amid urgent demand.
Reason: The problem involves multiple stages (cooking, packaging, and quality checks) that can be performed in varying orders across a set of portable stations. The key here is the flexibility in the order of operations and the presence of parallel processing constraints, which aligns with the Hybrid Flow-shop Scheduling Problem (HFSSP). This variant allows for the modeling of multiple stages where at least one stage has parallel machines, and it can accommodate the need for minimizing the total time to deliver all meals by optimizing the sequence and allocation of tasks.

Description: A cosmetics plant processes <num_jobs> skincare product batches through ordered phases (mixing, emulsifying, filling, labeling) on <num_machines> hygienic machines. Each phase is assigned to a dedicated machine with fixed durations in <processing_times>. Machines are sterilized between batches and enforce single-operation processing. Batches must follow regulatory-compliant sequences. The goal is to minimize makespan while ensuring adherence to FDA-grade hygiene and batch traceability rules.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each batch (job) of skincare products goes through a fixed sequence of operations (mixing, emulsifying, filling, labeling), and each operation is assigned to a dedicated machine. This setup perfectly matches the definition of the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP), where all jobs follow the same sequence of machines. The goal of minimizing the makespan while adhering to specific rules (like hygiene and traceability) aligns with typical objectives in FSSP, making it the most appropriate choice among the given variants.

Description: A luxury perfumery crafts <num_jobs> custom fragrances using <num_machines> stations for oil extraction, blending, aging, and bottling. The artisans can reorder steps to optimize workflow, with each fragrance requiring all stages (durations in <processing_times>). No station can handle multiple fragrances concurrently. The goal is to minimize the total production time.
Reason: The problem involves a fixed set of operations (oil extraction, blending, aging, and bottling) that must be performed in the same order for each fragrance. This matches the definition of the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP), where all jobs follow the same sequence of machines. The flexibility to reorder steps mentioned in the description refers to optimizing the workflow within these constraints, not changing the required sequence of operations. There is no indication of multiple machines at any stage or flexible machine choices, which would suggest other variants like HFSSP or FJSSP.

Description: A factory assembles <num_jobs> custom robots using <num_machines> modular stations (e.g., motor fitting, sensor integration, programming). The assembly sequence for each robot is adaptable, as long as all stations are visited. Processing times per station are listed in <processing_times>, and collisions (multiple robots at one station) are prohibited. The scheduler optimizes the order of operations to minimize the total assembly makespan.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each robot (job) needs to visit all stations, but the order in which these stations are visited can be flexible. This means there is no fixed sequence for all jobs as required by FSSP or HFSSP, and not every job has a predefined operation order as would be the case with JSSP. The flexibility in choosing the order of operations per job, combined with the need to avoid collisions at any station, aligns well with the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP).

Description: A logistics company manages <num_jobs> drones requiring battery swaps, sensor recalibration, and system diagnostics across <num_machines> service docks. The maintenance sequence is adaptable, with each task duration specified in <processing_times>. Only one drone can be serviced per dock at a time, and each drone can undergo only one procedure at once. The scheduler aims to minimize the total downtime of the fleet.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each drone (job) requires a series of maintenance tasks (operations) including battery swaps, sensor recalibration, and system diagnostics. These tasks can be performed in any order, which means the operation sequence is not strictly predefined. Additionally, the drones can be serviced at any of the available service docks, implying flexibility in machine choice. However, since there is no mention of complex precedence constraints or hybrid stages with parallel machines, and given the nature of adaptable sequences without strict order, the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) best fits this scenario as it allows for flexible machine choices per operation and does not enforce a strict order of operations.

Every candle follows this sequence, with each operation tied to a specific machine. Processing times (e.g., melting duration, curing time) are fixed and noted in <processing_times>. The schedule optimizes the makespan to fulfill all orders efficiently.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each candle (job) follows a specific sequence of operations (wax melting, fragrance infusion, wick insertion, pouring into molds, and curing), and each operation is tied to a specific machine. This matches the characteristics of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), where there is a fixed machine for each operation and a predefined order of operations for each job.

The assembly sequence is flexible to accommodate artisan preferences and machine bottlenecks. Task durations (see <processing_times>) are fixed, and stations cannot process multiple jobs concurrently. The scheduler optimizes the workflow to reduce total completion time.
Reason: The problem description indicates that there is a set of operations (frame welding, paint curing, gear tuning, and safety checks) for each bicycle (job), and the assembly sequence can be flexible to accommodate artisan preferences and machine bottlenecks. This flexibility in choosing which machine performs an operation while maintaining a predefined order of operations matches the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP).

The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total time to complete all trials—while ensuring regulatory compliance and efficient resource use.
Reason: The problem described involves a pharmaceutical lab conducting multiple drug trials, each requiring processing on specialized machines. The order of the tests (operations) for each trial (job) is flexible, and there are different processing times per test. No machine can handle multiple trials at the same time, and the goal is to minimize the makespan. This scenario closely matches the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where operations have a flexible machine choice but still follow a predefined sequence for each job, which fits the requirement that each trial must complete all steps in some order.

The analysis sequence per case is flexible, but each machine can handle only one task at a time. Processing durations are defined in <processing_times>. The goal is to minimize the total time to complete all forensic analyses.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each case (job) can be processed on any of the available specialized machines, and the sequence of operations for each case is flexible. However, each machine can only handle one task at a time, which means there is no fixed order of operations for all jobs but rather a choice of machines for each operation.

The scheduler aims to minimize the total production time while maintaining flexibility in workflow sequencing.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the order of operations is adaptable to artisan availability, which indicates a flexible sequence for each garment. Additionally, there is no indication of fixed machine per operation, but rather an emphasis on flexibility in both the choice of workstation and the sequencing of tasks. This matches best with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where there is flexibility in choosing which machine to use for each operation, even though a specific order of operations for each job might be considered, this flexibility in scheduling and machine selection is the key aspect here.

The chefs prioritize minimizing the makespan—the time until the last meal is served—while ensuring no station overlaps.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each multi-course meal (job) requires processing at all stations, implying a fixed sequence of operations for all meals. This matches the characteristics of the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP), where all jobs follow the same machine sequence.

The setup tasks can be reordered based on team availability, but each venue requires all steps (times in <processing_times>). Only one task per team or venue can occur at once. The objective is to minimize the time until all venues are ready.
Reason: The problem involves multiple technician teams (machines) that can be assigned to different setup tasks (jobs) with the flexibility to reorder the tasks based on team availability. However, it is specified that each venue (job) requires all steps, implying a fixed sequence of operations for each job. There is no mention of parallel processing at any stage or precedence constraints beyond the requirement that all steps for a venue must be completed, and only one task per team or venue can occur at once.

The sequence of stages is flexible to optimize technician workflows. Each stage’s duration is defined in <processing_times>, and no two packs can occupy the same stage simultaneously. The goal is to minimize total refurbishment time across all packs.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the sequence of stages (disassembly, diagnostics, reconditioning, repackaging) is flexible to optimize technician workflows, which means there is no fixed order for the operations. Additionally, it is mentioned that each stage can be used by only one battery pack at a time, implying that the machine choice per operation is also flexible.

Each repair step has a fixed duration (see <processing_times>), and no two repairs can occupy the same workstation simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the total time to return all devices to customers.
Reason: The problem involves multiple jobs (smartphones) that require a series of operations (diagnostics, screen replacement, battery testing, and software calibration). Each operation can be performed at any available workstation, indicating flexibility in machine choice. The order of repairs is flexible, which means there is no strict predefined sequence for the operations, but each job has to go through all specified steps.

The scheduler aims to minimize downtime by reducing the total maintenance window.
Reason: The problem involves scheduling a set of rides (jobs) across multiple service teams (machines) with the goal of minimizing the total maintenance window. Each ride must go through all service teams in a flexible order, and each team can only work on one ride at a time. This matches the characteristics of the FJSSP, where there is flexibility in the choice of which machine (service team) performs an operation (maintenance check) for each job (ride), but the operations (checks) are predefined for each job (ride).

Description: A space agency tests <num_jobs> satellite modules across <num_machines> rigs (thermal vacuum, vibration, electromagnetic). Modules must complete all tests, but the order is configurable to avoid bottlenecks. Test durations are listed in <processing_times>, and each rig can only handle one module at a time. The objective is to minimize the makespan—the time to certify all modules for launch.
Reason: The problem involves multiple types of tests (thermal vacuum, vibration, electromagnetic) that each satellite module must undergo. The order in which these tests are performed can be configured, indicating a flexible sequence. Additionally, there is no mention of precedence constraints or specific sequences all modules must follow, ruling out FSSP, HFSSP, and ASP. Since the operations (tests) do not have a fixed machine assignment and the order is configurable to avoid bottlenecks, this aligns well with the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP).

Description: A boutique coffee roaster processes <num_jobs> batches of beans through <num_machines> stages (e.g., sorting, roasting, grinding, and packaging). The sequence can vary to prioritize freshness or equipment availability. Each stage’s duration is listed in <processing_times>, and no two batches can use the same machine simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the makespan while preserving flavor profiles.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the coffee roasting process involves multiple stages (sorting, roasting, grinding, and packaging) for each batch, with the ability to vary the sequence based on freshness or equipment availability. This suggests flexibility in both the order of operations and the choice of machines at each stage. However, since there is a clear indication of different stages, it does not fully align with an open shop scenario where no predefined order exists. The presence of a fixed set of stages for all jobs, yet with the possibility to change the sequence and potentially use different machines for the same operation, most closely matches the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 24
Description: A DevOps team manages <num_jobs> software releases requiring <num_machines> stages (code review, testing, containerization, deployment). The pipeline allows flexible stage ordering (e.g., testing before or after containerization) to optimize resource usage. Stage durations are in <processing_times>, and concurrent execution is forbidden per stage. The scheduler aims to minimize the total deployment makespan.
Reason: The problem description indicates that there are multiple stages (code review, testing, containerization, deployment) and the order of these stages can be flexible to optimize resource usage. This flexibility in the ordering of operations, along with the constraint that each stage must be completed on a specific machine without concurrent execution, aligns closely with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). The FJSSP allows for a choice of machines per operation and also accommodates a flexible order of operations, which is suitable for the scenario described.

Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 39
Description: A theme park schedules <num_jobs> rides for maintenance across <num_machines> service teams (mechanical, electrical, safety checks, and cosmetic touch-ups). The order of maintenance tasks per ride is adjustable based on team availability. Task durations are specified in <processing_times>, and each team can service only one ride at a time. The objective is to minimize the total downtime for all rides.
Reason: The problem involves scheduling maintenance tasks for rides across different service teams, where the order of tasks per ride can be adjusted based on team availability. This indicates a level of flexibility in choosing which team (machine) services a ride (job) at any given time, without a strictly defined sequence of operations for all jobs. The goal is to minimize total downtime, which aligns with optimizing the schedule. Since there is no strict predefined order for the operations (tasks) and there is flexibility in assigning tasks to the service teams, this scenario best fits the definition of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP).

Description: A lunar base project assembles <num_jobs> habitat modules using <num_machines> robotic arms for welding, insulation, and life-support system installation. The assembly sequence is flexible to accommodate delayed cargo shipments. Task durations (see <processing_times>) depend on module complexity. The goal is to minimize total construction time despite strict single-machine-use constraints.
Reason: The problem description mentions that the assembly sequence is flexible to accommodate delayed cargo shipments, and task durations depend on module complexity. This indicates a need for flexibility in both the machine choice per operation and the operation order, which aligns with the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). The goal to minimize total construction time under constraints like single-machine-use further supports this classification. Although there are precedence constraints implied by the assembly process, the core requirement of flexibility in machine use and operation order makes FJSSP the most suitable variant.

Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 60
Description: A logistics company operates <num_jobs> delivery drones that require recharging, battery diagnostics, and software updates across <num_machines> service stations. The order of servicing is flexible, but each drone must complete all tasks before redeployment. The processing times for each task (recharging, diagnostics, updates) are specified in <processing_times>. The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total time to prepare the entire fleet for the next mission—while ensuring no station or drone is double-booked.
Reason: The problem involves a set of drones (jobs) that need to go through a series of tasks (operations) such as recharging, diagnostics, and software updates. The order of these tasks is flexible for each drone, and the drones can be serviced by any of the available service stations (machines). Since there is no strict sequence that all jobs must follow, but each job has its own set of operations that can be performed in any order, this scenario best fits the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). This variant allows for the flexibility in machine choice per operation and does not require a predefined order of operations, which aligns with the given problem statement.

Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 40
Description: A smart home company must configure <num_jobs> custom installations, each requiring setup across <num_machines> workstations (e.g., lighting, security, HVAC, and automation hubs). The sequence of installations is flexible, but each task has fixed durations (<processing_times>). Only one technician can work on a system at a time, and each workstation can handle only one task simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the total project completion time while ensuring efficient resource allocation.
Reason: The problem involves multiple custom installations (jobs) that need to be set up across different workstations (machines). Each installation has a fixed duration and must follow a specific sequence. However, the user mentioned that the sequence of installations is flexible, indicating that there is no strict order for when each job starts, but once a job begins, it follows a predefined sequence. This description closely matches the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where jobs have a predefined operation order but can choose from among available machines for each operation, which in this case would be the different workstations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 82
Description: A farm deploys <num_jobs> drones to perform <num_machines> tasks (soil scanning, pesticide spraying, crop health imaging) across fields. The operation order is flexible, but each drone must complete all tasks without interruption. Task durations (from <processing_times>) vary by field size. The objective is to minimize the makespan—the time until the last drone finishes—while ensuring no two drones use the same equipment simultaneously.
Reason: The problem involves a set of drones (jobs) that need to perform a series of tasks (operations) with flexible operation order but each drone must complete all tasks without interruption. There is also a requirement that no two drones use the same equipment simultaneously, which implies a resource constraint. The objective is to minimize the makespan, which fits well into the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) where there is flexibility in choosing which machine (in this case, task or field) a job (drone) can be assigned to, and the operations for each job do not have a strictly predefined order.

Description: A studio renders <num_jobs> animation scenes across <num_machines> GPU servers, each handling tasks like modeling, texturing, and lighting. The order of tasks is flexible, but all must be completed per scene. Render times (see <processing_times>) depend on complexity, and each server can only process one task at a time. The scheduler optimizes assignments to meet tight deadlines.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each scene (job) goes through a series of tasks (operations) such as modeling, texturing, and lighting. The order of these tasks is flexible, meaning there is no strict sequence that all jobs must follow. Additionally, the rendering process allows for flexibility in which GPU server (machine) handles each task, indicating that not every operation is tied to a specific machine. These characteristics align with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where there is a choice of machines for each operation and the order of operations can be adjusted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 37
Description: A sports arena hosts <num_jobs> tournaments (e.g., basketball, volleyball, and badminton) that require <num_machines> court configurations (flooring, net setup, lighting, and signage). The order of court conversions is flexible but must avoid overlaps. Conversion times per sport are listed in <processing_times>. The scheduler aims to minimize the makespan—the total time to prepare all courts for all tournaments.
Reason: The problem involves scheduling multiple tournaments (jobs) that require different court configurations (machines), with each tournament having a specific sequence of setup operations (e.g., flooring, net setup, lighting, and signage). The flexibility in the order of these operations and the need to avoid overlaps while minimizing the makespan closely aligns with the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). This variant allows for flexible machine (court configuration) choices per operation, which is necessary given that not all sports might require the same set of configurations, and it supports a predefined but flexible operation order.

Label: FSSP, Predicted: JSSP, Index: 88
Description: An optical lab coats <num_jobs> prescription lenses through <num_machines> stages: cleaning, anti-reflective layer deposition, UV hardening, and inspection. Each lens follows this sequence, with stage *i* reserved for machine *i*. Processing times per lens are predefined (<processing_times>), and machines are non-shareable. The schedule aims to minimize the makespan to meet urgent customer orders.
Reason: The problem involves a fixed sequence of operations (cleaning, anti-reflective layer deposition, UV hardening, and inspection) for each lens, with each stage being performed by a dedicated machine. This matches the definition of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), where there is a predefined order of operations for each job and each operation is to be performed on a specific machine.

Label: FJSSP, Predicted: FSSP, Index: 89
Description: A space tech workshop produces <num_jobs> rocket engine components through ordered processes: composite layup, cryogenic hardening, precision machining, and pressure testing. Each operation can use <num_machines> specialized machines (e.g., autoclaves, CNC mills), with durations in <processing_times>. Non-preemptive scheduling ensures safety compliance while reducing lead time for mission-critical parts.
Reason: The problem description indicates that there are ordered processes for producing rocket engine components, with each operation using specialized machines. It is also mentioned that the operations follow a specific sequence (composite layup, cryogenic hardening, precision machining, and pressure testing) which aligns with all jobs following the same machine sequence. This matches the definition of the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP), where every job goes through a series of stages in the same order. Although there are multiple machines per type, this does not change the fundamental nature of the problem being a flow shop, as the key aspect is the fixed sequence of operations for all jobs.

Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 41
Description: An art restoration studio processes <num_jobs> paintings through <num_machines> specialized stations (e.g., cleaning, varnish removal, retouching, and framing). The order of operations is flexible, allowing conservators to optimize workflow based on equipment availability. Each restoration step has predefined durations (<processing_times>), and no two tasks can occupy the same station simultaneously. The objective is to minimize the makespan—the total time needed to restore all artworks.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the order of operations for restoring paintings is flexible, and each operation can be performed at a specialized station. This flexibility in choosing both the order and the station for each task points towards a scenario where there is no fixed sequence for all jobs, but rather an optimization based on availability and efficiency. The objective to minimize the makespan, along with the characteristics of having multiple tasks and machines, aligns closely with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), which allows for flexible machine choice per operation while considering the overall schedule to complete all tasks efficiently.

Label: JSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 92
Description: A naval engineering facility constructs <num_jobs> titanium pressure hulls for crewed submersibles using <num_machines> hydroforming and robotic welding cells. Each hull undergoes 15+ non-parallelizable stages (spherical segment annealing, penetrator sealing, acoustic window bonding) with <processing_times> dictated by metallurgical requirements. Critical path operations like hyperbaric testing occupy dedicated chambers for 72+ continuous hours. Scheduling must minimize makespan while synchronizing with limited availability of 6,000-atmosphere test facilities.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each titanium pressure hull (job) undergoes a series of non-parallelizable stages, which implies a fixed sequence of operations. Additionally, the use of hydroforming and robotic welding cells suggests that there is some flexibility in choosing the machines for certain operations. The critical path operations, such as hyperbaric testing, occupy dedicated chambers, indicating specific resource constraints. Given these characteristics, the most fitting variant is FJSSP because it allows for flexible machine choice per operation while maintaining a predefined operation order.

Description: A logistics hub manages <num_jobs> autonomous robots that require periodic charging, diagnostics, and software updates across <num_machines> service bays. Each robot must complete all maintenance tasks, but the sequence is flexible to avoid bottlenecks. Task durations (e.g., charging time, calibration) are specified in <processing_times>. The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total downtime of the fleet—while ensuring no two robots occupy the same bay simultaneously.
Reason: The problem involves a set of robots (jobs) that need to go through a series of maintenance tasks (operations) at different service bays (machines). The sequence of operations for each robot is flexible, and the objective is to minimize the makespan while ensuring no two robots use the same bay simultaneously. This scenario fits the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where there is flexibility in choosing which machine (service bay) will perform each operation (maintenance task), and although the order of operations can be adjusted, each robot must complete all its tasks.

Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 14
Description: A clinical trial center schedules <num_jobs> participants through <num_machines> assessments (e.g., blood tests, cognitive exams, imaging). The assessment order is flexible to accommodate patient preferences and machine availability. Each test’s duration is in <processing_times>, and no overlapping bookings are allowed per machine. The scheduler optimizes assignments to minimize the total trial duration (makespan).
Reason: The problem description indicates that each participant (job) needs to go through a series of assessments (operations) with flexible order and choice of machines, without any strict sequence or assembly requirement. This flexibility in both the order of operations and the choice of which machine performs each operation best matches the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). The goal to minimize the total trial duration (makespan) is also a common objective in FJSSP.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 95
Description: A logistics company manages <num_jobs> delivery robots that require periodic charging, battery checks, and software updates across <num_machines> service stations. The sequence of maintenance tasks is flexible, but each robot must complete all procedures before returning to service. Processing times for charging, diagnostics, and updates are specified in <processing_times>. The goal is to minimize the total downtime of the fleet by optimizing the scheduling of these tasks.
Reason: The problem description indicates that there is a set of tasks (charging, diagnostics, and updates) that need to be completed for each robot, but the sequence of these tasks is flexible. This means that while each robot must go through all the specified maintenance procedures, the order in which they do so can be optimized. This characteristic closely matches the definition of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where the choice of machine for an operation is flexible, and there is a predefined set of operations, even though their specific order can vary.

Description: A Swiss watchmaker crafts <num_jobs> bespoke timepieces using <num_machines> workstations for movement assembly, casing, dial finishing, and quality control. Artisans can reorder non-critical steps (e.g., polishing before engraving) to optimize workflow. Each operation’s duration is listed in <processing_times>. The workshop aims to minimize total production time while adhering to one-job-per-machine constraints.
Reason: The problem involves multiple workstations for different tasks (movement assembly, casing, dial finishing, and quality control) where each task can be considered an operation. The user mentioned that the artisans can reorder non-critical steps, which implies a level of flexibility in the sequence of operations, except for those constrained by precedence. This matches well with the Assembly Scheduling Problem (ASP), as it allows for some operations to have specific order constraints while others can be more flexible. The goal is to minimize the total production time, aligning with scheduling objectives. Given these characteristics, ASP is the most suitable variant among the options provided.

Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 98
Description: A space agency assembles <num_jobs> satellite payloads using <num_machines> integration bays for tasks like sensor calibration, structural testing, and software uploads. The operation sequence is flexible to accommodate delays or priority changes. Task durations are in <processing_times>, and each bay can handle only one payload at a time. The goal is to minimize the makespan to meet tight launch windows.
Reason: The problem involves assembling satellite payloads with tasks like sensor calibration, structural testing, and software uploads. Each task can be performed in any of the integration bays, indicating a flexible machine choice per operation. The goal is to minimize the makespan, and the sequence of operations is flexible, which aligns with the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). Although there is a flexibility in the operation sequence, it is implied that each payload will follow a specific set of tasks, just not necessarily in a rigid order, which further supports FJSSP over OSSP or ASP. HFSSP and FSSP do not fit well as they either imply all jobs following the same sequence (FSSP) or having multiple stages with parallel machines (HFSSP), neither of which are specifically highlighted in the problem description.

Description: An NGO coordinates <num_jobs> food batches (meals, snacks, beverages) across <num_machines> cooking stations (grills, stoves, blenders) in a temporary kitchen. While all stations must be used for each batch, the order can vary based on ingredient readiness. Cooking times per station are defined in <processing_times>. The goal is to minimize the total time to prepare all batches, ensuring timely delivery to affected communities.
Reason: The problem involves scheduling multiple food batches (jobs) across different cooking stations (machines), where each station must be used for every batch, but the order can vary based on ingredient readiness. This flexibility in the choice of the order of operations per job, while still requiring all stations to be used, best matches the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). The FJSSP allows for a flexible machine choice per operation and a predefined (though not strictly fixed) sequence of operations, which aligns with the requirement that all cooking stations are utilized for each batch but the specific order can adapt based on external factors like ingredient availability.

Description: An automotive factory must paint <num_jobs> vehicle bodies using <num_machines> stations (primer, base coat, clear coat, and inspection). The sequence of stations is adjustable to optimize throughput. Each painting step’s duration is defined in <processing_times>, and no station can paint more than one vehicle at a time. The goal is to minimize the total time to complete all paint jobs.
Reason: The problem involves a sequence of stations (primer, base coat, clear coat, and inspection) for painting vehicle bodies where the sequence can be adjusted. Each vehicle (job) goes through the same set of operations but in a potentially different order to optimize throughput, which is characteristic of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). This variant allows for flexibility in choosing the order of operations while ensuring that each operation is performed on a specific machine, fitting well with the scenario described.

Description: A studio processes <num_jobs> event photo albums through <num_machines> editing stages (color correction, retouching, cropping, and watermarking). The workflow order for each album is flexible, and each stage’s time per album is given in <processing_times>. The studio aims to minimize the total editing time (makespan) while ensuring no two albums are in the same stage simultaneously and no album is processed at multiple stages concurrently.
Reason: The problem involves processing multiple event photo albums (jobs) through a series of editing stages (operations) where the order of operations for each album can be flexible. Each stage has a specific time required to process an album, and the goal is to minimize the total editing time while ensuring that no two albums are in the same stage at the same time, and no album is processed in more than one stage simultaneously. This scenario closely matches the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), which allows for flexibility in the choice of machines (or in this case, stages) per operation and a predefined but flexible order of operations.

Description: A luxury watchmaker crafts <num_jobs> gear components through <num_machines> specialized machines: CNC cutting, deburring, heat treatment, polishing, and dimensional verification. Every gear must pass through these stages in the same strict order, with exclusive machine usage. The exact processing times for each operation are provided in <processing_times>. The schedule aims to minimize the total production time (makespan) for all gears.
Reason: The problem describes a scenario where each gear (job) must pass through a series of operations in a strict, predefined order using specific machines for each operation. This aligns with the definition of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), as it involves a fixed machine for each operation and a predefined sequence that all jobs must follow.

Description: A research team deploys <num_jobs> sensor arrays across <num_machines> calibration and testing stations (e.g., humidity, temperature, air quality). Each array must pass all tests, but the sequence is flexible to accommodate equipment availability. Processing times for each test are given in <processing_times>. The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total time required to calibrate all sensors—while ensuring no station processes multiple arrays simultaneously.
Reason: The problem involves multiple sensor arrays (jobs) that need to be processed across several testing stations (machines), with the goal of minimizing the makespan. Each array must pass all tests, indicating a set sequence of operations for each job. However, the sequence is flexible based on equipment availability, which means there is flexibility in choosing which station processes an array at any given time, but once a station starts processing an array, it cannot process another until completion. This matches the definition of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where jobs have a predefined order of operations, and there is flexibility in the choice of machines for each operation.

The order of stations is adaptable to ingredient readiness and volunteer availability. Each batch’s processing time per station is defined in <processing_times>, with stations handling one batch at a time. The goal is to minimize the makespan to accelerate food distribution.
Reason: The problem involves multiple stations (machines) where the order of processing can be adapted, and each station processes one batch at a time. Since the order of stations is adaptable based on ingredient readiness and volunteer availability, this implies flexibility in the sequence of operations for each meal batch. This characteristic aligns with the definition of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), which allows for flexible machine choice per operation while maintaining a predefined order of operations for each job.

All wallets follow this exact sequence, with each operation bound to a specific machine. Processing times are fixed and listed in <processing_times>. The schedule aims to minimize the makespan—the total time to complete all wallets.
Reason: The problem description indicates that all wallets (jobs) follow the exact same sequence of operations (cutting, stitching, edge painting, and hardware attachment) on specific machines. This means there is a fixed order of operations for each job and a predefined machine for each operation, which aligns perfectly with the definition of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). The objective to minimize the makespan further supports this classification.

Every table follows this fixed sequence, with each step bound to a dedicated machine. Parallel processing is prohibited, and operation durations are specified in <processing_times>. The scheduler aims to minimize the total completion time for all tables.
Reason: The problem describes a scenario where each table (job) goes through a fixed sequence of operations (sanding, staining, varnishing, and drying) on dedicated machines, with no flexibility in choosing the machine for each operation. This matches the definition of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), which involves a fixed machine per operation and a predefined order of operations. The aim to minimize the total completion time is also a common objective in JSSP. Since there is no indication of flexible machine assignment, parallel processing within stages, or an open shop setting, JSSP is the most fitting variant.

Description: A disaster response team must set up <num_jobs> temporary field hospitals, each requiring <num_machines> modular units (e.g., triage tents, surgical stations, pharmacy, and recovery beds). The setup order for each hospital is adaptable to logistics constraints. Processing times for assembling each unit are given in <processing_times>, and only one team can work on a unit at a time. The objective is to minimize the total deployment time to operationalize all hospitals.
Reason: The problem description indicates that there is a set of jobs (setting up hospitals) with each job requiring a specific number of operations (assembling modular units). The order of these operations can be adapted to logistics constraints, suggesting some flexibility in the sequence. However, since the primary focus is on minimizing the total deployment time and the operations for setting up each hospital are independent (each unit can be seen as an operation that needs to be completed, and only one team works on a unit at a time), it aligns closely with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). This variant allows for the selection of different machines (or teams) to perform operations, and although the overall order of setting up hospitals may be flexible, the setup process for each hospital (i.e., the sequence of assembling modular units) seems to follow a more predefined path, which is characteristic of FJSSP rather than completely open or hybrid flow-shop scenarios.

Each operation uses specialized bioreactors or analyzers from <num_machines>, with time-sensitive processing durations (<processing_times>). Non-preemptive scheduling ensures viability, and minimizing makespan is vital for urgent medical treatments.
Reason: The problem involves manufacturing patient-specific gene therapies, which suggests that each therapy (job) follows a specific sequence of operations (DNA synthesis, viral vector loading, sterility testing, and vial filling). The mention of specialized bioreactors or analyzers implies that there are multiple machines, and the fact that non-preemptive scheduling is used to ensure viability indicates a need for a fixed machine per operation with a predefined order. This closely aligns with the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), where each job has a set sequence of operations on specific machines.

Each step uses <num_machines> isolator-equipped machines to maintain aseptic conditions, with processing times in <processing_times>. Strict operation order and machine compatibility constraints apply. The schedule must minimize makespan to expedite life-saving shipments.
Reason: The problem involves processing vaccine batches through a series of steps (sterile filling, capping, labeling, and cold storage) where each step must follow a strict order, indicating a predefined operation sequence. Additionally, the description mentions that there are multiple machines (isolator-equipped) for each step, which suggests parallel processing at each stage. This closely matches the definition of HFSSP, as it includes multiple stages with parallel machines in at least one stage, and adheres to a specific operation order.

Description: A tech manufacturer assembles <num_jobs> customized smartphones using <num_machines> workstations for tasks like screen calibration, battery installation, software flashing, and quality testing. The assembly sequence is flexible, allowing operators to prioritize tasks based on workstation availability. Each task duration is specified in <processing_times>, and no two jobs can occupy the same machine simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the total production time (makespan) while ensuring all devices meet delivery deadlines.
Reason: The problem involves assembling customized smartphones where the assembly sequence is flexible, and operators can prioritize tasks based on workstation availability. This indicates that while there are specific tasks to be completed (such as screen calibration, battery installation, etc.), the order in which these tasks are performed can be adjusted. Moreover, each task has a specified duration, and no two jobs can use the same machine at the same time. The goal of minimizing the total production time (makespan) while ensuring all devices meet their delivery deadlines aligns with the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where the choice of machines for operations is flexible but the set of operations for each job is predefined.

The setup order for each venue is adaptable based on crew availability. Task durations (e.g., calibrating projectors) are listed in <processing_times>. Since teams and equipment are shared, the schedule must avoid overlaps while minimizing the total setup time across all venues.
Reason: The problem involves configuring multiple screening venues (jobs) with a set of resources (machines) such as projectors, sound systems, seating, and lighting rigs. The setup order for each venue is adaptable based on crew availability, indicating that there is no strict predefined order for the operations. This flexibility in both the machine choice per operation and the operation sequence itself aligns well with the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). Additionally, the requirement to avoid overlaps and minimize the total setup time across all venues fits within the scope of FJSSP, where the goal is to efficiently schedule jobs on available machines while considering the constraints of the system.

Each order must pass through all stations, but the sequence is adaptable to reduce bottlenecks. Task durations are specified in <processing_times>, and each station can only handle one order at a time. The scheduler aims to minimize production time while accommodating last-minute design changes.
Reason: The problem describes a scenario where each custom furniture order (job) must pass through all workstations, indicating a fixed sequence for the operations. However, it is specified that the sequence can be adapted to reduce bottlenecks, and task durations are known. The requirement to minimize production time with the flexibility to adapt the sequence of operations and accommodate last-minute design changes suggests a need for flexibility in machine choice or operation sequencing beyond a strictly defined order. This description aligns closely with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), which allows for flexible machine choices per operation while still having a predefined overall operation order. The FJSSP also aims to optimize the schedule, which fits well with the goal of minimizing production time.

Cylinders follow this strict sequence, with each i-th operation bound to the i-th machine. Processing times (including safety checks) are fixed in <processing_times>. The schedule must minimize makespan to accelerate emergency supply chains.
Reason: The problem specifies that each cylinder (job) follows a strict sequence of operations through a series of machines, with each operation being bound to a specific machine. This matches the definition of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), where there is a fixed machine per operation and a predefined order of operations for each job. The goal is to minimize the makespan, which is a common objective in JSSP.

Description: An optical lab crafts <num_jobs> prescription lenses through <num_machines> precision steps: blank cutting, surface grinding, polishing, anti-reflective coating, and final inspection. Every lens follows the same rigid sequence, with each i-th operation assigned to the i-th machine. Machines can handle only one lens at a time, and processing times are fixed (see <processing_times>). The scheduling objective is to minimize the makespan—the total production time for all lenses.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each lens (job) follows a rigid, fixed sequence of operations on specific machines. This matches the definition of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), where for each operation, there is a predefined and dedicated machine, and the order of operations is fixed. There is no indication of flexibility in choosing machines or operations, nor any parallel processing within stages, ruling out FJSSP, HFSSP, and other variants. The problem also does not fit the criteria for an Open Shop or Assembly Scheduling Problem as it has a clear and unchanging sequence of operations for all lenses.

Description: A luxury eyewear workshop crafts <num_jobs> bespoke frames through <num_machines> precision steps: material cutting, hinge fitting, polishing, and quality inspection. Every frame must pass through the machines in the same fixed order, with exclusive machine usage. The processing times for each operation are specified in <processing_times>. The scheduling objective is to minimize the total production time (makespan) for all frames.
Reason: The problem specifies that every frame (job) must pass through a series of machines in the same fixed order, with each operation having a specific machine and a predefined sequence. This directly matches the definition of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), where there is a fixed machine per operation and a predefined operation order for all jobs. The objective to minimize the total production time (makespan) further aligns with the JSSP.

Description: A prefab housing factory assembles <num_jobs> modular units using <num_machines> workstations (e.g., framing, plumbing, electrical, finishing). The assembly sequence is adaptable to worker availability, with task times defined in <processing_times>. Each unit must pass through all stations, but no station can process multiple units simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total time to complete all units.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each modular unit (job) must pass through all workstations in a specific sequence, which aligns with the characteristics of the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem. There is no mention of flexibility in choosing machines for operations or any hybrid setup with parallel machines. Additionally, the primary objective is to minimize the makespan, which is a common goal in FSSP. The requirement that no station can process multiple units simultaneously also supports this classification.

Description: A luxury perfumery processes <num_jobs> custom fragrance orders through <num_machines> stations (essential oil extraction, blending, aging, bottling). Clients choose ingredients, but the workflow order is flexible to balance artisan availability. Step durations (e.g., aging time) are in <processing_times>. The scheduler aims to minimize the makespan—the time to fulfill all orders without overlapping station usage.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the workflow order is flexible to balance artisan availability, and there are multiple stations (essential oil extraction, blending, aging, bottling) through which custom fragrance orders must be processed. The goal is to minimize the makespan without overlapping station usage, and since the order of operations can be adjusted, this flexibility in both machine choice and operation sequence points towards a scenario where not only the machines but also the order of operations for each job can be selected. This matches the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), as it allows for flexible machine choices per operation and the ability to adjust the order of operations.

Description: A logistics company manages <num_jobs> drone delivery orders, each requiring processing at <num_machines> stations: battery charging, payload loading, navigation calibration, and safety checks. The sequence of operations is flexible, allowing the scheduler to optimize for throughput. Each task’s duration is specified in <processing_times>, and no station or drone can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total time to prepare all drones for dispatch.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each drone (job) needs to go through a series of operations at different stations, and the sequence of these operations is flexible. This flexibility in choosing the order of operations while still adhering to the need for each operation to be completed once per job, aligns with the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). The goal to minimize the makespan, along with the constraints on no station or drone handling multiple tasks simultaneously, further supports this classification. Other variants like JSSP, FSSP, HFSSP, OSSP, and ASP do not fully capture the flexibility in operation sequence as described in the problem.

Description: A cloud provider allocates <num_jobs> computational jobs (e.g., data analysis, rendering, simulations) across <num_machines> virtual machines (VMs). Each job must use all VMs, but the execution order is flexible. Processing times per VM are defined in <processing_times>, and no VM can handle multiple jobs concurrently. The scheduler aims to minimize the makespan—the time until all jobs are completed.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each job must use all VMs, but the order of execution is flexible. This means that while there is a set sequence of machines (VMs) that each job must go through, the order in which jobs are processed on these machines can be adjusted to minimize the makespan. This characteristic aligns with the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP), where all jobs follow the same sequence of machines, and the goal is often to optimize an objective such as minimizing the makespan.

Description: A chocolatier crafts <num_jobs> specialty batches through <num_machines> stages (tempering, molding, decorating, packaging). The production sequence is flexible to accommodate ingredient readiness or artisan availability. Stage durations are listed in <processing_times>, and each machine handles one batch at a time. The objective is to minimize the total production time while ensuring freshness.
Reason: The problem involves multiple stages (tempering, molding, decorating, packaging) for each job (batch), and all jobs follow the same sequence of these stages. There is no mention of parallel machines at any stage or flexibility in choosing different machines for the same operation, which rules out FJSSP and HFSSP. Since the operations are to be performed in a specific order, OSSP and ASP do not apply. The JSSP typically implies that each operation can be performed on a unique machine, but here, the process is more like a flow where each job goes through the same sequence of stages. Therefore, the most appropriate variant is FSSP, as it accurately describes a scenario where all jobs go through the same series of steps in the same order, aiming to minimize the total production time.

Description: A luxury watchmaker produces <num_jobs> gear sets through <num_machines> precision machining steps: blank cutting, CNC shaping, polishing, and quality inspection. Every gear set must pass through the machines in the same fixed order, with exclusive machine usage. The exact processing times for each operation are given in <processing_times>. The scheduling objective is to minimize the makespan (total production time) for all gear sets.
Reason: The problem description indicates that every gear set must pass through the machines in a fixed order, with each operation being performed on a specific machine. This matches the definition of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), where there is a predefined sequence of operations for each job and each operation is assigned to a particular machine.

Description: A conservation lab handles <num_jobs> artworks needing cleaning, structural repair, pigment analysis, and varnishing across <num_machines> specialized workstations. The sequence of treatments is adaptable to prioritize fragile items or resource availability. Each restoration step has fixed durations (see <processing_times>), and only one artwork can occupy a workstation at a time. The objective is to minimize the total project completion time while preserving artistic integrity.
Reason: The problem involves multiple artworks (jobs) that need to go through a series of treatments (operations) such as cleaning, structural repair, pigment analysis, and varnishing. The sequence of these treatments is adaptable, meaning there is no fixed order, but the artworks can be prioritized based on fragility or resource availability. Since each restoration step has a fixed duration and only one artwork can occupy a workstation at a time, this scenario best fits the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). This variant allows for flexible machine choice per operation, which aligns with the possibility of adapting the sequence of treatments. Additionally, while the order of operations can be adjusted, it does not fit the criteria for an open shop where there is absolutely no predefined operation order, nor does it strictly follow the same machine sequence for all jobs, ruling out the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem.

Description: A boutique sneaker workshop handles <num_jobs> customer orders, each requiring <num_machines> steps like laser etching, dyeing, sole customization, and quality control. The order of operations is adaptable—e.g., etching can precede or follow dyeing—to balance workload. Task durations vary per design (see <processing_times>), and each machine processes one sneaker at a time. The scheduler aims to minimize the total production time while ensuring artisanal quality.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each customer order (job) requires multiple steps (operations) which can be performed in a flexible order, and the choice of machines for some operations is also flexible. This aligns with the characteristics of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where there is flexibility both in the sequence of operations and in the selection of machines to perform those operations, aiming to minimize total production time while adhering to specific constraints.

Description: A specialty workshop restores classic motorcycles with <num_jobs> tasks across <num_machines> workbenches, such as engine disassembly, chroming, carburetor tuning, and upholstery. Precedence constraints (e.g., painting cannot start before sandblasting) are modeled in <precedence_relations>, with labor hours in <processing_times>. The goal is to minimize project duration while preserving authenticity.
Reason: The problem involves multiple tasks (operations) for each motorcycle (job) with specific precedence constraints, and it is mentioned that there are different workbenches (machines) to perform these tasks. The description also highlights the importance of following a certain order, such as painting cannot start before sandblasting, which aligns well with the definition of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem where operations have a fixed machine and a predefined operation order. Although there could be some flexibility in choosing the workbench for a given task, the core aspect of having a defined sequence of operations makes JSSP the most fitting choice. Additionally, the goal to minimize the project duration while respecting these constraints is typical for a JSSP scenario.

Description: A humanitarian team operates <num_machines> cooking stations (chopping, boiling, baking, packaging) to prepare <num_jobs> batches of meals for disaster survivors. The workflow is flexible—e.g., packaging can occur before baking if resources are available. Each step’s time is defined in <processing_times>, and stations can handle only one batch at a time. The objective is to minimize the makespan to accelerate meal distribution.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the workflow is flexible, meaning the order of operations like packaging and baking can be changed based on resource availability. This suggests a high level of flexibility not only in which machine performs an operation but also in the order of operations for each job, aligning closely with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) where there is a choice in both the sequence of operations and the machines used, although the overall sequence of operations per batch is still defined.

Description: A rescue team coordinates <num_jobs> robotic units to clear debris from a disaster zone using <num_machines> specialized tools (crushers, sorters, transporters). Each robot must use all tools, but the order depends on real-time obstacle discovery. Task durations (e.g., crushing concrete) are in <processing_times>. The goal is to minimize the total operation time, ensuring no tool or robot is idle.
Reason: The problem involves multiple robotic units (jobs) that need to use a set of specialized tools (machines) in an order that can change based on real-time conditions. This indicates a flexible choice of machine per operation, but the order is not strictly predefined due to real-time obstacle discovery. Additionally, the goal is to minimize the total operation time with no tool or robot being idle, which aligns closely with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) where operations can be performed by any available machine and the sequence of operations may vary.

Description: A high-end shipyard handles <num_jobs> yachts undergoing bespoke modifications like hull polishing, interior upholstery, and engine tuning across <num_machines> specialized workstations. The order of operations is adaptable to resource availability, with each task duration defined in <processing_times>. Only one yacht can occupy a workstation at a time. The objective is to minimize the makespan—the total time to complete all customizations—while ensuring no workstation conflicts.
Reason: The problem involves scheduling yachts (jobs) across specialized workstations (machines) where the order of operations can be adapted based on resource availability, and each operation has a defined duration. The key aspect here is the flexibility in choosing which workstation performs each task, without a strict predefined sequence for all jobs, but with an aim to minimize the makespan. This scenario closely matches the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), as it allows for flexible machine choice per operation while maintaining a certain order of tasks that needs to be completed for each yacht.

Description: An automated warehouse processes <num_jobs> customer orders using <num_machines> robotic stations for picking, packing, labeling, and quality checks. The sequence of operations is adaptable to avoid congestion, with each task duration specified in <processing_times>. Only one order can occupy a station at a time. The scheduler aims to minimize the total fulfillment time (makespan) while balancing workload across robots.
Reason: The problem description mentions an automated warehouse with robotic stations for various tasks like picking, packing, labeling, and quality checks. The key point is that the sequence of operations can be adapted to avoid congestion, which indicates flexibility in choosing the order of operations. However, it also specifies that each task has a defined duration and only one order can occupy a station at a time. This setup closely matches the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) because it allows for flexible machine choice per operation while maintaining a predefined operation order. Additionally, the goal of minimizing the total fulfillment time (makespan) and balancing workload across robots aligns well with the objectives of FJSSP.

Description: A craft brewery manages <num_jobs> beer batches through <num_machines> stages (mashing, boiling, fermenting, carbonating). The sequence of stages is flexible—e.g., some batches may ferment before carbonation, while others reverse the order—to optimize tank availability. Each stage’s duration per batch is defined in <processing_times>, with tanks reserved for one batch at a time. The goal is to minimize the total production time to meet seasonal demand spikes.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each beer batch goes through a set of stages (mashing, boiling, fermenting, carbonating) where the sequence of these stages can be flexible. This flexibility in the order of operations while still needing to complete all specified stages for each job (beer batch) aligns with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). The goal is to optimize the total production time, taking into account the duration of each stage and the need for tank availability, which fits within the scope of FJSSP by allowing a flexible sequence of operations to minimize the makespan.

Description: An EV battery factory assembles <num_jobs> custom battery packs using <num_machines> workstations for cell sorting, welding, cooling system integration, and quality testing. The assembly sequence is flexible, allowing parallelization to reduce bottlenecks. Each operation’s duration is specified in <processing_times>, and no workstation can handle multiple packs simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total time to deliver all orders.
Reason: The problem description indicates a scenario where there are multiple workstations (machines) for different operations, and the assembly sequence is flexible, allowing for parallelization. This suggests that while there is a general flow of operations, not all jobs need to follow an identical sequence through the machines, and the choice of which workstation to use for each operation can be flexible. However, it is clear that there is a defined set of operations with specific durations and a requirement to minimize the makespan. These characteristics align closely with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), as it allows for the flexibility in machine choice per operation but maintains a predefined order of operations.

Description: A pharmaceutical plant produces <num_jobs> vaccine batches using <num_machines> modular stations (mixing, purification, vial filling, labeling). Regulations require all steps per batch, but the order can adapt to equipment availability or priority shifts. Each step’s duration is listed in <processing_times>. The scheduler must minimize production time, avoiding overlaps where one machine handles multiple batches simultaneously.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each vaccine batch (job) must go through a series of steps (operations) such as mixing, purification, vial filling, and labeling. The order of these steps can be adapted based on equipment availability or priority shifts, which means the operations do not have a strictly fixed sequence. Additionally, it is mentioned that there are multiple modular stations for performing these operations, suggesting flexibility in choosing which machine to use for a given operation. This aligns with the definition of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where operations for jobs can be processed on any of the available machines, and the order of operations can be adjusted.

Description: A traveling film festival must prepare <num_jobs> screening venues by configuring <num_machines> equipment sets (projectors, sound systems, seating). Each venue requires all setups, but the sequence depends on crew availability and venue access. Setup times per task (e.g., calibrating audio) are in <processing_times>. The objective is to minimize the total setup time before the festival opens.
Reason: The problem describes a scenario where there are multiple venues (jobs) that need to be set up using different equipment sets (machines). The sequence of setups can vary based on crew availability and venue access, indicating flexibility in the order of operations for each job. This aligns with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), which allows for flexible machine choice per operation and has a predefined operation order for each job, fitting well with the given context of configuring venues with specific but flexibly ordered tasks.

Description: A tech factory assembles <num_jobs> custom smartphones using <num_machines> modular stations (camera calibration, battery install, software flash). While all stations must process each phone, the sequence is adaptable to bottlenecks. Assembly times per station are in <processing_times>, and stations can’t multitask. The goal is to minimize the production makespan to meet shipping deadlines.
Reason: The problem involves a set of custom smartphones (jobs) that need to go through a series of modular stations (machines) with the flexibility to adapt the sequence of processing at these stations based on bottlenecks. However, all phones must be processed by each station, implying a common sequence for all jobs, which aligns with the characteristics of the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem. There is no mention of parallel machines in any stage or the necessity to choose from multiple machines for an operation, nor is there an indication of operations without a predefined order, ruling out HFSSP, FJSSP, and OSSP. The goal to minimize makespan also fits well within the objectives typically addressed in FSSP. While the ASP might seem applicable due to the assembly nature of the task, the core requirement here is about sequencing a fixed set of operations (stations) for all jobs, which is more accurately described by the FSSP.

Description: A pharmaceutical plant manufactures <num_jobs> vaccine batches using <num_machines> modular units (mRNA synthesis, lipid encapsulation, purification, and vial filling). Regulatory constraints allow flexible stage sequencing but require exclusive machine access. Processing times (from <processing_times>) depend on batch size. The scheduler aims to minimize the makespan to accelerate vaccine distribution.
Reason: The problem involves a pharmaceutical plant that manufactures vaccine batches using modular units with specific stages (mRNA synthesis, lipid encapsulation, purification, and vial filling). The operations for each batch follow the same sequence of these stages. Although there is flexibility in the sequencing of the stages due to regulatory constraints, all jobs (vaccine batches) still follow the same overall process flow. This scenario closely matches the definition of the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP), where all jobs go through the same sequence of machines (or in this case, processing stages). The requirement to minimize the makespan while adhering to the stage-specific and exclusive machine access further aligns with the characteristics of FSSP.

Description: A research facility tests <num_jobs> self-driving car prototypes across <num_machines> environments (e.g., urban simulation, off-road track, sensor calibration lab). Tests can be conducted in any order, but each prototype must complete all scenarios. Testing times per environment are listed in <processing_times>, and no two cars can share a testbed simultaneously. The objective is to minimize the total testing period to accelerate development cycles.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each self-driving car prototype (job) must be tested across multiple environments (machines), and there is a specific sequence in which these tests (operations) need to be completed for each prototype. Additionally, the testing times are specified for each environment, and no two prototypes can use the same testbed at the same time. Since the order of operations (tests) is predefined for each job (prototype) and each operation (test) has a designated machine (environment), this matches the characteristics of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

Each drone must complete all tasks, but the sequence is flexible to account for weather or battery constraints. Task durations (e.g., refueling, data upload) are specified in <processing_times>. The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total time to complete all missions while ensuring no station or drone is double-booked.
Reason: The problem involves a set of tasks (soil sampling, crop spraying, thermal imaging) that need to be performed by autonomous drones. The key aspects here are the flexibility in the sequence of tasks for each drone and the goal to minimize the makespan while ensuring no double-booking of stations or drones. This matches closely with the FJSSP (Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem), where operations can be performed on different machines (charging/processing stations) and the order of operations is flexible, allowing for adjustments based on weather or battery constraints.

Description: A high-end restaurant prepares <num_jobs> multi-course meals using <num_machines> kitchen stations (grill, sauté, oven, plating). Each dish requires all stations, but chefs can reorder steps to avoid congestion. Station-specific prep times are in <processing_times>. The kitchen must minimize the total service time (makespan) while ensuring no station works on more than one dish simultaneously and no dish is processed at multiple stations at once.
Reason: The problem describes a scenario where each dish (job) needs to go through all kitchen stations (machines) in a sequence that can be adjusted to avoid congestion, indicating a fixed set of operations for each job but with the flexibility to reorder these operations. This does not fit into a simple flow shop or open shop model because there is a defined sequence of operations for each job, even if it can be rearranged. The JSSP (Job Shop Scheduling Problem) typically assumes a fixed order of operations, which is slightly different from the described scenario where reordering is allowed. However, given the options, JSSP is the closest match as it deals with a fixed set of machines for each operation, and the ability to reorder steps can be seen as an optimization within the constraints of the JSSP. The other variants do not fit as well: FJSSP allows for flexible machine choice, FSSP and HFSSP assume a strict sequence across all jobs, OSSP lacks a predefined sequence, and ASP focuses on assembly processes with precedence constraints.

Every guitar follows this exact workflow, with exclusive machine usage. Processing times for each operation are fixed and listed in <processing_times>. The scheduling objective is to minimize the total production time for all guitars.
Reason: The problem description specifies that every guitar (job) follows an exact workflow through a series of stages, with each stage using exclusive machine usage. This indicates a fixed sequence of operations for all jobs and a fixed machine per operation, which aligns perfectly with the definition of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).

Description: A pharmaceutical plant produces <num_jobs> vaccine batches using <num_machines> stations for mixing, filtration, vial filling, and quality control. The production sequence can be dynamically adjusted to avoid bottlenecks. Each batch must pass through all stations (duration in <processing_times>), with no parallel processing per station. The scheduler aims to minimize the total production time to meet urgent demand.
Reason: The problem describes a scenario where each vaccine batch (job) must pass through all stations in a specific sequence, which is a characteristic of the Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP). Since it is mentioned that there are no parallel processes per station and the production sequence can be dynamically adjusted to avoid bottlenecks with the aim to minimize the total production time, this aligns perfectly with FSSP. The other variants do not fit as well; for example, JSSP and FJSSP allow for more flexibility in machine choice or operation order, HFSSP involves parallel machines in at least one stage, OSSP does not have a predefined sequence, and ASP is focused on assembly operations with precedence constraints.

Description: A farm deploys <num_jobs> crop-monitoring drones daily, requiring <num_machines> pre-flight steps: battery charging, sensor calibration, and payload attachment. The order of steps is flexible, but each drone must complete all tasks (see <processing_times>) before takeoff. Only one drone can use a charging pad or calibration tool at a time. The scheduler minimizes the makespan to ensure early-morning deployment.
Reason: The problem involves a set of drones (jobs) that need to go through a series of pre-flight steps (operations) which include battery charging, sensor calibration, and payload attachment. The order of these operations is flexible, meaning the sequence can be adjusted for each drone, and there are constraints on resource usage (e.g., only one drone can use a charging pad or calibration tool at a time). Since the operations do not have a fixed order and the machines (or stations) used for each operation are specified but with flexibility in their choice, this scenario best fits the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) variant.

Description: A semiconductor plant processes <num_jobs> silicon wafers through <num_machines> stages like lithography, etching, doping, and inspection. The order of operations is flexible, allowing wafers to move dynamically between machines to avoid bottlenecks. Each stage has a fixed duration (see <processing_times>), and no machine can handle multiple wafers simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total production time for all wafers—while ensuring high equipment utilization.
Reason: The problem description indicates that the silicon wafers (jobs) need to go through multiple stages, and there is flexibility in choosing which machine will process each wafer at each stage. However, the order of operations for each wafer is not strictly predefined but rather can be dynamically adjusted to avoid bottlenecks, which points towards a certain level of operation sequence flexibility. This setup closely matches the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where jobs have a specific set of operations with a flexible choice of machines per operation, and although an overall order is considered, it allows dynamic adjustment to optimize the schedule. The goal of minimizing the makespan while ensuring high equipment utilization aligns well with FJSSP objectives.

The sequence of steps can vary per order to optimize throughput. Task durations are listed in <processing_times>, and no two orders can use the same equipment simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the total time to fulfill all orders.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each custom cake order (job) has a sequence of steps (operations) like mixing, baking, decorating, and packaging. The sequence of these steps can be optimized, meaning it is not strictly predefined for all orders, which rules out JSSP and FSSP where the sequence is fixed. Since there is flexibility in choosing the equipment (machines) for each step, and the goal is to minimize the total time while respecting that no two orders can use the same equipment simultaneously, this fits the definition of the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP).

The order of maintenance tasks is flexible, but each robot must complete all procedures before returning to service. Processing times for charging, diagnostics, and updates are specified in <processing_times>. The goal is to minimize the total downtime of the fleet by optimizing the sequence of operations.
Reason: The problem involves multiple robots (jobs) that need to go through a series of maintenance tasks (operations) which include charging, diagnostics, and software updates. The order of these tasks is flexible, meaning there is no fixed sequence for all robots, but each robot must complete all tasks. Since the service stations can be seen as machines, and the robots have flexibility in choosing which station to use for their operations without a strict order, this scenario best matches the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP).

The order of pre-flight checks is adaptable to weather conditions. Task times (from <processing_times>) vary by drone model. The objective is to minimize the makespan—the time until all drones are airborne—while avoiding parallel resource conflicts.
Reason: The problem involves scheduling a set of drones (jobs) that need to go through a series of stations (machines) for pre-flight checks. The order of these checks can be adapted based on weather conditions, indicating flexibility in the sequence of operations. Additionally, there is a requirement to avoid parallel resource conflicts and minimize the makespan. This closely aligns with the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), where each job (drone) can have a flexible machine (station) choice per operation, and while there is an overall process, the specific sequence can be adjusted. The presence of varying task times by drone model further supports this classification as it implies different processing times on potentially different machines, which is characteristic of FJSSP.

Label: OSSP, Predicted: FJSSP, Index: 90
Description: A logistics company operates <num_jobs> delivery drones requiring battery swaps, sensor recalibration, and payload checks across <num_machines> service bays. The sequence of maintenance tasks is flexible, but each drone must complete all procedures before redeployment. Task durations vary (see <processing_times>), and no bay can service multiple drones simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the makespan—the total downtime of the fleet.
Reason: The problem description indicates that each drone (job) needs to go through a series of maintenance tasks (operations) including battery swaps, sensor recalibration, and payload checks. The sequence of these maintenance tasks is flexible, which implies that there is no fixed order for the operations. Moreover, the service bays (machines) can be chosen flexibly for performing these tasks, as long as all procedures are completed before redeployment. This flexibility in both the choice of machines and the order of operations points towards the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP). The goal to minimize the makespan aligns with typical objectives in scheduling problems, further supporting this classification.
