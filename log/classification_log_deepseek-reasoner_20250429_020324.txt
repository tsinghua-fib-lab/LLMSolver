Description: Aircraft manufacturers must precisely arrange lightweight reinforced composite sheets (<items_size>) onto large structural wing molds (<bin_size>). The challenge lies in optimizing the placement of irregularly shaped carbon-fiber sheets purely along their length and width dimensions to achieve maximum coverage, reduce material overlap, and maintain structural integrity while minimizing excess weight. This requires strategic sheet orientation to align with aerodynamic stress patterns.
Reason: The problem involves placing 2D items (composite sheets) into 2D bins (wing molds) with a focus on length and width. The mention of "strategic sheet orientation to align with aerodynamic stress patterns" explicitly indicates that rotation is allowed to optimize placement. Since the problem does not describe items arriving sequentially or unknown future item dimensions, it is an offline scenario. Thus, the most specific variant is 2D Offline Rotatable Bin Packing Problem (2DOFBPPR).

Description: Specialized construction crews must transport custom-fabricated glass panes and window frames to urban skyscraper sites using elevator shafts with non-negotiable size restrictions <bin_size>. The fragile architectural components vary from large curtain wall sections to smaller ventilation windows <items_size>. The critical requirement is safe transportation with optimal bin usage to reduce costly multiple elevator trips.
Reason: The problem involves 2D items (glass panes and window frames with length and width, as height is not mentioned and likely negligible) being packed into elevator shafts (2D bins with size restrictions). All items are known in advance (offline) for optimal trip planning, and rotation is not mentioned, so it's disallowed by default.

Description: In the beverage industry, bottles and cans of various sizes (<items_size>) arrive continuously on a conveyor belt and must be packed into plastic crates (<bin_size>) for delivery to retail stores. Workers cannot predict the exact dimensions or quantities of upcoming beverages, requiring real-time decisions about how to orient each item based on its length, width, and height to maximize crate utilization while preventing breakage during transit.
Reason: The problem involves 3D items (bottles/cans with length, width, height) and 3D bins (plastic crates), and workers must make real-time decisions as items arrive sequentially without knowledge of future items, confirming an online scenario. The requirement to orient items based on their dimensions implies rotation is allowed to optimize packing, making 3DONBPPR the most specific variant.

Label: 3DOFBPP, Predicted: 2DOFBPP, Index: 50
Description: A school district is moving prefabricated classroom units to different campuses using flatbed trucks with strict dimension limits <bin_size>. Each modular classroom consists of wall panels, flooring sections, and furniture components of varying shapes and sizes <items_size>. The goal is to optimize truck space to minimize transportation costs while protecting fragile items like whiteboards and tabletops during transit.
Reason: The problem involves packing 2D items (flatbed trucks have length and width constraints; no mention of stacking implies height is not a factor). All items are known upfront (offline), and there is no mention of rotation being allowed. The focus is on optimizing space without fragile items being damaged, which aligns with non-rotatable 2D offline bin packing.

Label: 3DONBPPR, Predicted: 2DONBPP, Index: 80
Description: Pharmaceutical companies assembling portable cleanrooms from prefabricated wall panels <bin_size> must efficiently load trucks with components like air filtration units and sterile workstations measuring <items_size>. Installation teams arriving on site need immediate unpacking without rotation restrictions, requiring intelligent cargo space allocation despite unpredictable loading sequences due to manufacturing variances.
Reason: The problem involves loading 2D items (air filtration units, sterile workstations) into 2D bins (truck cargo space) with no mention of height constraints, indicating a 2D problem. The loading sequence is unpredictable (manufacturing variances), requiring an online approach. Installation teams do not have rotation restrictions during unpacking, but the problem does not explicitly allow rotation during packing, so rotation is disabled by default. This matches the 2D Online Bin Packing Problem (2DONBPP).

Label: 3DONBPPR, Predicted: 2DONBPPR, Index: 77
Description: During emergency relief operations, modular medical tents with interior space <bin_size> must be rapidly stocked with critical equipment like ventilators and supply kits of dimensions <items_size>. With supplies arriving unpredictably from multiple donors, volunteers must immediately place each rotated item without knowing subsequent deliveries, requiring smart spatial allocation to accommodate essential equipment under time pressure.
Reason: The problem involves placing 2D items (ventilators and supply kits with specified dimensions) into 2D bins (medical tents) under an online scenario where items arrive sequentially and future item dimensions are unknown. Additionally, the description explicitly mentions that items can be rotated ("rotated item"), which aligns with the Rotatable (R) variant. There is no indication of 3D constraints (e.g., height or stacking), confirming this is a 2D problem. The time pressure and unpredictable arrivals necessitate an online approach (ON).

Label: 3DONBPPR, Predicted: 2DONBPPR, Index: 98
Description: Construction companies must efficiently load building materials such as beams, bricks, and piping <items_size> onto transport pallets <bin_size> as they are prepared at the site, with no advance knowledge of upcoming material sizes. Workers can rotate items to improve fit but must decide on placement without delaying the loading process, aiming to minimize the number of pallets used for cost-effective transportation.
Reason: The problem description specifies that items arrive with no advance knowledge of upcoming sizes (online), items are 2D (beams, bricks, piping loaded onto pallets, implying length and width only), and rotation is allowed to improve fit. This matches the 2D Online Rotatable Bin Packing Problem (2DONBPPR).

Description: An audiophile seeks to organize an extensive collection of vintage records in protective sleeves <items_size> within limited cabinet space featuring adjustable shelving units <bin_size>. The objective involves creating the most compact album arrangement while maintaining alphabetical accessibility and preventing sleeve edge damage from overcrowding.
Reason: The problem involves organizing 2D items (vintage records in protective sleeves with length and width) into 2D bins (adjustable shelving units with length and width). Since all items are known upfront (offline) and there is no mention of allowing rotation, the most specific variant is 2D Offline Bin Packing Problem (2DOFBPP).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: 3DOFBPP, Predicted: 3DONBPP, Index: 92
Description: Farming cooperatives need to move freshly picked produce like melons, squash, and pumpkins from fields to processing facilities using vented crop trailers <bin_size>. Irregularly shaped harvest batches <items_size> must be arranged to prevent bruising during transit while maximizing each truckload's economic value within narrow post-harvest freshness windows.
Reason: The problem involves arranging 3D items (produce with irregular shapes) into 3D bins (vented crop trailers) without stacking (due to bruising concerns), requiring consideration of all three dimensions. Since harvest batches must be packed sequentially under time constraints (narrow freshness windows), the items are likely processed as they arrive (online), and there is no mention of rotation being allowed. This matches the 3D Online Bin Packing Problem (3DONBPP).

Description: A construction firm is preparing to deliver and install custom-designed windows for a skyscraper project using reinforced shipping frames with set measurements <bin_size>. The fragile glass panes and architectural components come in assorted profiles and packaging styles <items_size>, demanding optimal arrangement to reduce transport trips while maintaining structural integrity under windy high-altitude conditions.
Reason: The problem involves packing 2D items (glass panes with length and width, as height is not mentioned) into 2D bins (shipping frames with set measurements). All items are known upfront (offline), and there is no mention of rotation being allowed, so it defaults to non-rotatable. Structural integrity concerns relate to packing stability but do not imply 3D considerations without explicit height dimensions.

Label: 3DONBPPR, Predicted: 2DONBPPR, Index: 95
Description: At a busy construction site, workers must organize building materials like pipes, beams, and tiles <items_size> into on-site storage containers <bin_size> as supplies arrive in random order. Items can be rotated to save space, but each must be placed upon arrival without knowledge of subsequent deliveries, with the goal of minimizing container usage while keeping materials accessible.
Reason: The problem involves items arriving sequentially without prior knowledge of future deliveries (online), allows rotation of items to save space (R), and deals with 2D items (pipes, beams, tiles) placed into 2D storage containers. There is no mention of height constraints or stacking, indicating a 2D problem rather than 3D.

Label: 3DOFBPP, Predicted: 2DOFBPP, Index: 97
Description: A metropolitan hospital needs to efficiently store thousands of medical supplies in clean-room cabinets with regulated compartment sizes <bin_size>. The sterile packages containing surgical tools, medication boxes, and diagnostic equipment all have varying dimensions <items_size> that must be systematically arranged to maintain quick access during emergencies while obeying healthcare facility storage regulations.
Reason: The problem involves storing medical supplies with varying dimensions into compartments (bins) of regulated sizes. Since all items and bins are known upfront (systematic arrangement for quick access suggests prior knowledge), it is an offline problem. The description does not mention rotation, so rotation is not allowed. Although medical supplies are physical 3D objects, the problem does not specify height for items or bins, implying a 2D abstraction (length and width only). Therefore, the most specific variant is 2D Offline Bin Packing Problem without rotation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description: During a library renovation, archivists must carefully transport fragile antique books of assorted sizes in custom protective cases <items_size> to temporary storage facilities using climate-controlled book crates with fixed dimensions <bin_size>. The challenge is to maximize crate capacity while preventing book crowding that could cause leather bindings to warp or pages to crease.
Reason: The problem involves 2D items (books in protective cases with assorted sizes, focusing on length and width) being packed into 2D bins (crates with fixed dimensions). The archivists are performing this task during a planned renovation, implying all items are known in advance (offline). There is no mention of rotating the protective cases, so rotation is not allowed. The goal is to maximize crate capacity while avoiding damage, aligning with the 2D Offline Bin Packing Problem (2DOFBPP) definition.
