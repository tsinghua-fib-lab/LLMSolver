Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 32
Description: Research vessels (<capacity>) service a network of marine buoys (<loc_customer>) from a coastal base (<loc_depot>). Some buoys require sensor replacements (<demand_linehaul>) while others need data retrieval (<demand_backhaul>). Vessels can service buoys in any order but face <distance_limit> nautical mile range limits due to fuel constraints. The challenge is to maximize scientific data recovery while minimizing operational costs across the buoy network.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands which can be serviced in any order (Mixed Backhaul, "MB"), distance limits ("L") due to fuel constraints, and no explicit requirement for returning to the depot (closed routes are implied by the absence of "O"). Time windows ("TW") are not mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 77
Description: Technicians maintain IoT sensors across a city (<loc_customer>) starting from a service center (<loc_depot>). Vehicles carry limited replacement parts (<capacity>) and must complete routes within battery life constraints (<distance_limit>). Some stops require sensor calibration (time-sensitive procedures with fixed <time_windows>) while others involve part replacements or data collection (flexible timing). Calibration procedures have strict duration requirements (<service_time>). The challenge is to optimize routes that respect all technical constraints while minimizing downtown of critical city infrastructure.
Reason: The problem includes distance limits (L) due to battery life constraints and time windows (TW) for calibration stops. Although capacity (C) is mentioned, the presence of L and TW takes precedence. There's no indication of backhaul (B) or open routes (O), so the most specific variant combining L and TW is VRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 65
Description: A biotech company operates a program to replace outdated lab equipment with cutting-edge models. Their logistics team must deliver new equipment (linehaul) to research facilities while collecting the obsolete devices (backhaul) for recycling. Each lab has a strict operational window for equipment swaps to avoid disrupting experiments, with service times requiring precise coordination. Vehicles are limited to a 200km route distance to ensure rapid deployment, and their capacity must accommodate both new gear and bulky old equipment. Routes conclude at the final lab without returning to the depot.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, mixed backhauls (MB) since both linehaul (new equipment) and backhaul (old equipment) occur at the same labs, distance limits (L) of 200km, and time window constraints (TW) for lab service. These attributes correspond to the OVRPMBLTW variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 85
Description: Marine telecommunications engineers must repair undersea internet cables at dispersed oceanic locations. Each repair site has tidal-based time windows (<time_windows>) during which vessels can dock safely. The maintenance vessels (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a coastal base (<loc_depot>), carrying specialized equipment. They must complete repairs before exhausting their fuel range (<distance_limit> km), as mid-ocean refueling is impossible. The goal is to plan routes that deliver all required gear to each site within their tidal windows, while ensuring no vessel exceeds its load or travel limits.
Reason: The problem includes time window constraints (<time_windows>) at repair sites (TW), distance limits due to fuel range (<distance_limit> km) (L), and vehicle capacity (<capacity> ton) (C). However, since TW and L are present, "C" is ignored per the classification rules. The description does not explicitly state that vehicles must return to the depot, but it also does not mention open routes (O), so the default assumption is closed routes. The most specific variant combining L and TW is VRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 18
Description: Organizers manage gourmet food trucks servicing multiple festival venues (<loc_customer>). Trucks restock ingredients from a commissary (<loc_depot>) and collect waste (<demand_backhaul>) while operating within venue-specific time slots (<time_windows>). Each truck has limited storage (<capacity>) and must complete routes in <time_limit> hours to maintain food freshness. Trucks remain at their final venue for overnight parking.
Reason: The problem includes open routes (O) as trucks do not return to the depot, mixed backhaul (MB) because trucks handle both ingredient restocking (linehaul) and waste collection (backhaul) at the same venues, and time windows (TW) for venue-specific service slots. These elements align with the 'OVRPMBTW' variant, which combines open routes, mixed backhaul, and time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 68
Description: A high-end hospitality group uses vans (capacity: <capacity>) to deliver fresh linens and toiletries (<demand_linehaul>) to hotels (<loc_customer>) while collecting used items for laundering (<demand_backhaul>). Deliveries must align with hotels’ strict restocking schedules (<time_windows>), and routes cannot exceed shift durations (<time_limit>). Vehicles may alternate deliveries and pickups dynamically to minimize idle time.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) since vehicles can alternate deliveries and pickups dynamically, time windows (TW) for restocking schedules, and a time limit (implied in TW constraints) for shift durations. There is no mention of open routes (O) or distance limits (L), so the most specific variant is VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 97
Description: A city’s seasonal bike-sharing program delivers bikes and gear to parks before peak hours (within strict delivery time windows). Returned equipment is later collected. Vehicles must first deliver rentals (linehaul) to park locations within time slots, then return to retrieve items (backhaul), managing capacity to avoid overloading. Timely service ensures equipment availability for users while optimizing routes for efficiency.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul demands (B) where vehicles must first deliver rentals (linehaul) and then collect returned items (backhaul), and time window constraints (TW) for deliveries during strict time slots. There is no mention of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhaul (MB), making VRPBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 74
Description: An outdoor adventure company delivers tents, sleeping bags, and camping gear to travelers (<loc_customer>) for weekend trips (linehaul) and later retrieves the gear post-adventure (backhaul). Each vehicle must first deliver the rented equipment (<demand_linehaul>) to pickup locations such as airports or campgrounds, then collect used gear (<demand_backhaul>) from return points like trailheads or drop-off zones. Routes must start at the central depot (<loc_depot>), prioritize deliveries before pickups, and conclude at the final return location. The goal is to minimize fuel costs while managing gear weight and space (<capacity>) across all stops.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) where vehicles must deliver linehaul items before collecting backhaul items, and there is a capacity constraint. The routes start and end at specified locations (depot and final return), but there is no mention of open routes (O), distance limits (L), time windows (TW), or mixed backhauls (MB). The presence of backhaul takes precedence over capacity, leading to the VRPB classification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 95
Description: A telecommunications provider must rapidly deploy temporary cell towers to disaster-affected regions to restore connectivity. Each site has a critical time window for installation to meet urgent demands. After the crisis, towers must be retrieved and returned to the depot. Vehicles must first deliver equipment (linehaul) within setup time windows, then later collect the towers (backhaul), ensuring deliveries precede pickups. Route planning must respect vehicle capacities and strict timelines to avoid overloading while minimizing travel distance.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW) for installation and strict timelines, backhaul (B) where deliveries must precede pickups, and vehicle capacity constraints. Since TW and B are present, the appropriate variant is VRPBTW, which combines backhaul with time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 79
Description: A research consortium supplies remote Arctic stations (<loc_customer>) via tracked vehicles during a brief ice-road season. The depot (<loc_depot>) must dispatch trucks with a maximum payload capacity (<capacity> tons) to deliver winter provisions. Each station’s window (<time_windows>) closes as ice melts, requiring precise timing. Additionally, vehicles cannot exceed a daily distance limit (<distance_limit> km) due to extreme cold and fuel scarcity. The goal is to ensure all stations are stocked before ice roads become impassable while avoiding vehicle breakdowns from overexertion.
Reason: The problem specifies time windows (<time_windows>) for deliveries, distance limits (<distance_limit> km) due to fuel constraints, and does not explicitly require vehicles to return to the depot after deliveries. Since the ice roads may become impassable, it implies open routes (O) where vehicles do not need to return. The combination of time windows (TW), distance limits (L), and open routes (O) makes OVRPLTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 8
Description: A municipal kitchen (<loc_depot>) prepares and delivers meals to <num_customer> schools (<loc_customer>), while also collecting food waste for composting. Each school has a meal demand (<demand_linehaul>), waste pickup requirement (<demand_backhaul>), and a lunchtime service window (<time_windows>). Refrigerated trucks (<capacity>) must complete routes within <distance_limit> km to maintain food safety. The challenge is to balance meal freshness (early deliveries) with waste collection efficiency, avoiding vehicle overloads.
Reason: The problem includes backhaul (B) for waste collection, distance limits (L) for food safety, and time windows (TW) for school service, requiring a variant that combines these features. The absence of explicit mention of mixed backhaul (MB) or open routes (O) supports selecting VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 71
Description: *Description:*  
A vertical farming company delivers fresh produce to restaurants (<loc_customer>) and picks up compost waste (mixed backhaul) from the same locations using refrigerated trucks (<capacity> kg). Restaurants specify narrow delivery windows (<time_windows>) to align with kitchen prep schedules. Trucks depart from the urban farm (<loc_depot>) and finish routes at waste processing plants (open routes). Routes are constrained by perishability-driven duration limits (<time_limit> hours) to ensure freshness. Demand includes both produce delivery (<demand_linehaul>) and compost collection (<demand_backhaul>).
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as trucks finish at waste plants, mixed backhaul (MB) since both delivery and compost collection occur at the same locations, and time windows (TW) specified by restaurants. There is no mention of distance limits (L) or strict backhaul order (B alone). Thus, OVRPMBTW is the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 24
Description: Drones (<capacity>) inspect and repair rooftop solar panels across a district, starting from a charging hub (<loc_depot>). Some sites require part deliveries (<demand_linehaul>), while others need faulty components collected (<demand_backhaul>). Time windows (<time_windows>) reflect daylight hours and homeowner availability. Drones recharge at their last location (open route). The problem balances battery life (implied by distance), mixed cargo, and strict appointment times for access permissions.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as drones do not return to the depot, mixed backhaul (MB) with simultaneous linehaul and backhaul demands, time windows (TW) for service, and battery life constraints implying distance limits (L). These features align with the OVRPMBLTW variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 52
Description: An automotive rental firm delivers leased vehicles (linehaul) to customers’ homes or offices by scheduled appointment times (TW). After the rental period ends, the same vehicles are picked up (backhaul) from return locations. Each truck can carry a limited number of vehicles (capacity), and routes must stay within a maximum daily distance to avoid driver fatigue and ensure timely pickups/drop-offs. The challenge is to coordinate delivery and return schedules, respect customer time windows, and optimize vehicle utilization without overextending drivers.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as vehicles must handle both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) in any order, time windows (TW) for customer appointments, and distance limits (L) to prevent overextending drivers. 'C' (capacity) is mentioned but ignored due to the presence of other features. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPMBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 2
Description: A diagnostic lab dispatches mobile units from a central facility (`<loc_depot>`) to:  
1. Deliver medical supplies to clinics (`<demand_linehaul>`).  
2. Collect lab samples from the same clinics (`<demand_backhaul>`).  
Units (capacity: `<capacity>`) must adhere to:  
- **Time windows** (`<time_windows>`): Clinics have strict sample collection hours (e.g., 9–11 AM).  
- **Distance limits** (`<distance_limit>`): Units cannot exceed 200 km/day due to refrigeration limits.  
- **Mixed backhauls**: A unit might deliver supplies to Clinic A, then collect samples from Clinic B.  
*Goal*: Ensure all clinics are served within constraints while minimizing fleet size.
Reason: The problem includes mixed backhauls (MB), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). The presence of mixed backhauls (allowing both linehaul and backhaul to be handled in any order) differentiates it from standard backhaul (B), and the combination of L and TW constraints further specifies the variant. The absence of open route (O) implies vehicles return to the depot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 80
Description: A wind farm operator must send maintenance crews to service offshore turbines. Each turbine requires a specific set of tools and crew members (<demand>), and can only be accessed during tidal windows (<time_windows>). Maintenance vessels (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a coastal depot (<loc_depot>), must return before depleting fuel (<distance_limit> km), and must prioritize urgent repairs. Routes must ensure all turbines are serviced within their operational windows while avoiding excessive travel for crews.
Reason: The problem includes time windows (tidal windows) for turbines (TW), distance limits due to fuel constraints (L), and requires vehicles to return to the depot (excluding O). There is no mention of backhaul or mixed backhaul (B/MB), so the most specific variant is VRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 88
Description: A touring festival organizer must set up stages at remote forest venues. Each site (<loc_customer>) has a setup time window (<time_windows>) before audience arrival. Flatbed trucks (<capacity> cubic meters) transport oversized equipment from a central storage facility (<loc_depot>). The trucks must complete deliveries before their fuel runs out (<distance_limit> km), as fuel stations are scarce in the wilderness. Routes must optimize travel paths to meet all deadlines without exceeding vehicle capacity or range limits.
Reason: The problem includes time windows (TW) for deliveries at each site and distance limits (L) due to fuel constraints. There is no mention of backhaul (B) or open routes (O), and capacity (C) is present but superseded by TW and L. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPLTW, combining distance limits and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 73
Description: A security provider deploys equipment (linehaul) to event venues before setup deadlines (TW) and retrieves gear (backhaul) after the event concludes (TW). Vehicles (C) must carry bulky equipment efficiently. Routes are constrained by distance limits (L) to ensure rapid deployment. Drivers start at the depot, deliver gear, then collect it afterward, ending at the depot for storage—avoiding extra trips to optimize resource use.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles that must perform both linehaul (delivery) and backhaul (collection) demands with time windows (TW) for each, constrained by distance limits (L). Since all linehaul must be completed before backhaul and vehicles must return to the depot (no open route), the most specific variant is VRPBLTW, which combines Backhaul (B), Distance Limits (L), and Time Windows (TW).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 22
Description: A healthcare provider rents specialized medical devices (e.g., wheelchairs, monitors) to patients and schedules pickups after their recovery. Delivery trucks (<capacity> devices) must first deliver equipment to patients’ homes (<time_windows>) before returning to collect devices from others. Each route is restricted to a 7-hour duration (<duration_limit>), and vehicles must not exceed their capacity during combined delivery and pickup loads. The solution must balance urgency of deliveries with efficient backhaul scheduling.
Reason: The problem involves Mixed Backhaul (MB) as both deliveries and pickups can be on the vehicle simultaneously (capacity must not be exceeded during combined loads), Time Windows (TW) for service at patient homes, and a route duration limit (L) of 7 hours. These features align with the 'VRPMBLTW' variant, which accounts for mixed backhauls, time windows, and route duration constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 76
Description: A furniture rental company services urban clients (<loc_customer>) from a warehouse (<loc_depot>) using trucks with limited cargo space (<capacity>). Each stop involves either delivering new furniture (linehaul) or collecting expired rentals (backhaul), with mixed sequencing allowed. Installation teams have fixed time windows (<time_windows>) at each location based on customer availability, and each service takes a predetermined time (<service_time>). Routes must be completed within driver shift limits (<time_limit>). The objective is to minimize operational costs while meeting all scheduling commitments.
Reason: The problem involves mixed sequencing of linehaul and backhaul (MB), time windows (TW), and capacity constraints. Since mixed backhaul (MB) and time windows (TW) are present, the variant prioritizes these features over capacity (C). No open route (O) or distance limits (L) are mentioned, so the most specific variant is VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 16
Description: An electronics retailer delivers new appliances to customers' homes (linehaul) and collects outdated devices for recycling (backhaul). Each delivery vehicle has a capacity limit for both outgoing and incoming loads. Deliveries must occur during customers' specified time windows (e.g., daytime for appliance setup), followed by pickups after the customer has prepared the old devices. Routes must not exceed a set distance to ensure drivers can complete tasks within a single shift. The goal is to optimize routes so all deliveries and pickups are completed efficiently without exceeding capacity or time/distance constraints.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) with time windows (TW) for both deliveries and pickups, distance limits (L) on routes, and requires linehaul to be completed before backhaul. There is no mention of open routes (O) or mixed backhaul (MB), making VRPBLTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 78
Description: A service provider circulates high-end amenities (linens, toiletries) to luxury hotels (<demand_linehaul>) while collecting used items for laundering (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have temperature-controlled compartments (<capacity>) and must adhere to hotels' strict delivery windows (<time_windows>) to avoid disrupting guest services. The MB flexibility enables routes like: deliver fresh towels to Hotel X → pick up dirty linens from Hotel Y → drop off new robes at Hotel Z.
Reason: The problem involves Mixed Backhaul (MB) as both linehaul and backhaul can be handled in any order (e.g., deliver → pick up → deliver again), and Time Windows (TW) due to strict delivery windows. There is no mention of open routes (O) or distance limits (L), so VRPMBTW is the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 51
Description: A film production company needs to deliver camera gear, lighting rigs, and props (linehaul) to multiple filming locations, each with strict time windows aligned with shooting schedules. After scenes are completed, they must retrieve the equipment (backhaul) for reuse on subsequent sets. Trucks must not exceed their capacity limits, balancing the weight of deliveries and pickups. Routes are designed to end at the final pickup location, avoiding unnecessary returns to base. The challenge is to ensure deliveries arrive before shoot times, pickups occur after wrap-ups, and vehicle loads remain within constraints while optimizing route efficiency.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles do not return to the depot), mixed backhauls (linehaul and backhaul operations can occur in any order, provided each pickup happens after its corresponding delivery), and time windows (strict deadlines for deliveries and pickups). These elements correspond to the O (open), MB (mixed backhaul), and TW (time window) attributes. Capacity constraints are present but secondary to these features.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: CVRP, Predicted: OVRP, Index: 91
Description: A global art collective needs to ship massive, custom-built components for a traveling exhibition to museums in different cities. Each museum (<loc_customer>) requires a unique set of pieces (<demand> in volume/weight), and transport trucks (<capacity> cubic meters/tons) have strict space and weight limits. The organizer must design routes from the central storage depot (<loc_depot>) to ensure all components reach their destinations intact, avoiding overloading while covering all <num_customer> locations efficiently.
Reason: The problem specifies designing routes from a central depot without mentioning the need for vehicles to return, indicating open routes (O). There are capacity constraints (C), but according to the rules, when other attributes like O are present, they take precedence. No mention of backhaul, time windows, or distance limits excludes other variants. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRP.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 13
Description: A winery delivers wine bottles (linehaul) to retail stores (<loc_customer>) and collects grape pomace (backhaul) from vineyards for composting. Trucks with a <capacity> kg limit must first complete all deliveries to ensure freshness, then proceed to vineyards for waste pickup. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius of the central warehouse (<loc_depot>) to maintain refrigeration for perishable items and reduce emissions. The winery aims to optimize fuel costs and logistical efficiency while adhering to strict capacity and distance restrictions.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) that must be satisfied after all linehaul deliveries, distance limits (L) restricting routes to a radius from the depot, and capacity constraints. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O), and backhaul and linehaul are handled sequentially (not mixed). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 13
Description: After a hurricane, relief teams distribute food/water (<demand_linehaul>) and collect damage reports (<demand_backhaul>) at neighborhoods (<loc_customer>) with curfew-enforced time windows (<time_windows>). Vehicles (capacity <capacity>) depart from a temporary depot (<loc_depot>), operate on open routes (O), and must complete missions within safety-driven distance limits (<distance_limit>).
Reason: The problem includes open routes (O), backhaul demand (B) with linehaul requiring completion before backhaul (as damage reports are collected after distributing supplies), distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). The combination of these features corresponds to the OVRPBLTW variant, which explicitly includes all mentioned constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 12
Description: An aviation maintenance company dispatches trucks to deliver replacement aircraft parts (linehaul) to airports (<loc_customer>) and later collect used or defective components (backhaul) for recycling. Each truck’s <capacity> kg limit must accommodate both outgoing parts and returned materials. Deliveries must precede pickups to ensure planes are serviced promptly. Furthermore, each truck’s route cannot exceed a <distance_limit> km limit to comply with flight crew schedules and avoid overnight travel. The depot (<loc_depot>) coordinates routes to minimize total distance while ensuring all parts are delivered and retrieved without violating constraints.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) where deliveries must precede pickups, distance limits (L) on routes, and no mention of open routes (O) or time windows (TW). The presence of both backhaul and distance constraints makes VRPBL the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 98
Description: A museum's outreach program sends educational kits to schools (<loc_customer>) using vans that depart from the museum (<loc_depot>). Each van carries fragile exhibits (<capacity> kg) and must arrive during school hours (<time_windows>). Some stops require collecting previous kits (backhaul) while others only need deliveries, with sequence flexibility. Drivers work maximum 5-hour shifts (<duration_limit>) to ensure kit quality. The challenge is to coordinate this mixed delivery/pickup operation while respecting time constraints and vehicle capacities.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as both deliveries and pickups can be sequenced flexibly, time windows (TW) for school hours, and vehicle capacity constraints. The absence of explicit open route (O) requirements or distance limits (L) makes VRPMBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 12
Description: A museum network rotates artworks between galleries while collecting pieces for conservation. Trucks (<capacity>) transport fragile items (mixed linehaul/backhaul) with temperature-controlled time windows (<time_windows>). Routes are limited to <time_limit> hours to prevent vibration damage. The main storage facility (<loc_depot>) coordinates 12 galleries (<loc_customer>) with specialized handling requirements (<demand_linehaul>, <demand_backhaul>, <service_time>).
Reason: The problem involves mixed linehaul/backhaul (MB) allowing simultaneous handling, temperature-controlled time windows (TW) for service, and a route time limit. Since 'MB' and 'TW' are present, and the route is closed (no 'O'), the correct variant is VRPMBTW. Capacity is mentioned but ignored due to other features.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 31
Description: An indoor farming company manages multiple vertical farms (<loc_customer>) requiring daily harvest pickups (<demand_backhaul>) and seed deliveries (<demand_linehaul>). Transport vehicles (<capacity>) depart from a distribution hub (<loc_depot>) and can sequence pickups/deliveries freely. Routes are constrained to <distance_limit> km to ensure produce freshness. The system must balance harvest collection with new seed distribution while optimizing fleet utilization.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) since both linehaul (seed deliveries) and backhaul (harvest pickups) can be sequenced freely, distance limits (L) are explicitly mentioned, and there is no requirement for vehicles to return to the depot (O) or time windows (TW). Capacity is present but ignored due to other features.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 69
Description: A security firm deploys barriers, cameras, and monitoring systems to venues hosting high-profile events. Trucks (<capacity> kg) must deliver equipment ahead of event start times (<time_window>), then retrieve gear immediately after the event concludes. Delivery routes prioritize venues with earlier start times, while pickups follow strict post-event schedules to avoid congestion. The <service_time> includes setup and takedown coordination with event staff, ensuring all equipment is secured before departing for the final stop.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (B) requirements, as trucks must deliver equipment first and then retrieve it after the event, and time window (TW) constraints for deliveries (prioritizing venues with earlier start times) and pickups (strict post-event schedules). The presence of backhaul and time windows makes VRPBTW the most specific variant. There is no mention of open routes (O) or distance limits (L), so these are excluded.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 34
Description: During a humanitarian crisis, relief agencies deploy trucks to deliver emergency supplies (food, medical kits, blankets) to temporary shelters (linehaul) and simultaneously collect waste and recyclable materials from the shelters (backhaul). Each truck’s capacity is constrained by the weight and volume of mixed cargo. Routes must respect time windows set by shelter operating hours and adhere to distance limits to ensure drivers can return to the depot for resupply without exceeding daily driving regulations. Deliveries must always occur before pickups to prioritize urgent needs.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as each shelter requires both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul) in sequence, time windows (TW) due to shelter operating hours, and distance limits (L) to ensure return to the depot. Deliveries must precede pickups at each shelter, fitting 'MB' (simultaneous linehaul/backhaul with precedence). 'O' is excluded as routes return to the depot. Thus, VRPMBLTW is the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 18
Description: A foodservice supplier delivers cooking oil, spices, and kitchenware to restaurants while collecting used cooking oil for biodiesel production. The trucks (capacity <capacity>) begin at the central warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering fresh supplies to multiple eateries. After completing all deliveries, the same vehicles collect the used oil from the same locations. This ensures that the vehicle’s capacity is not exceeded during deliveries and that hazardous materials are handled safely in the return phase. The aim is to optimize routes for minimal fuel costs and environmental impact.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles that first deliver goods (linehaul) and then collect used oil (backhaul) after all deliveries are completed, which fits the Backhaul (B) constraint. There is a capacity constraint mentioned, but since B is present, C is ignored. There are no mentions of open routes, distance limits, or time windows, so the most specific variant is VRPB.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 39
Description: A fashion brand circulates inventory between temporary pop-up shops (<loc_customer>) using cargo bikes (capacity <capacity>). Starting from a central showroom (<loc_depot>), couriers distribute new collections (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieve unsold items (<demand_backhaul>) in dynamic routes that adapt to daily sales data. Couriers clock out at their final destination, enabling flexible shift planning. The objective is to maximize product exposure while minimizing transit time between high-demand locations.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (distributing new collections) and backhaul (retrieving unsold items) demands. Couriers start at the depot but do not return to it (open route, "O"). Although capacity is mentioned, "O" and "B" take precedence over "C". The description does not explicitly mention mixed backhaul (MB), time windows (TW), or distance limits (L), so the most specific variant is OVRPB (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhaul).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 78
Description: A catering company deploys food trucks from a commissary (<loc_depot>) to multiple festival locations (<loc_customer>). Each truck has limited ingredient capacity (<capacity>) and must complete its route before perishables expire (<time_limit>). Stops involve both delivering fresh supplies to satellite vendors (linehaul) and collecting unsold food for composting (backhaul), with flexible sequencing. Each festival location has strict vendor access windows (<time_windows>) and unloading takes variable time (<service_time>). The goal is to maximize freshness while minimizing fuel costs across all routes.
Reason: The problem includes time windows (<time_windows>), mixed backhaul (flexible sequencing of linehaul and backhaul), and open routes (no explicit requirement to return to the depot). The capacity constraint is present but ignored due to other features. The combination of 'O' (open), 'MB' (mixed backhaul), and 'TW' (time windows) makes 'OVRPMBTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 96
Description: A rail operator expands services temporarily and needs to install ticketing kiosks and boarding gates at stations. Each station has a setup time window to avoid disrupting regular operations. After the expansion, equipment must be retrieved. Vehicles must deliver gear (linehaul) to stations within their time windows, then return later to collect items (backhaul), ensuring deliveries come first. Routes must balance capacity limits and time constraints to maintain service schedules.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) where linehaul deliveries must be completed before backhaul pickups, and time window constraints (TW) at each station. There is no mention of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhauls (MB). Thus, the combination of backhaul and time windows (VRPBTW) is the most specific variant.

Description: A construction firm coordinates trucks to deliver materials to sites (<demand_linehaul>) and haul away debris (<demand_backhaul>) from the same locations (<loc_customer>). Vehicles (capacity <capacity>) depart from a storage yard (<loc_depot>) with distance limits (<distance_limit>) to comply with driver regulations. Sites enforce time windows (<time_windows>) for noise-sensitive areas. Trucks may finish at disposal facilities after debris pickups.
Reason: The problem includes open routes (trucks may finish at disposal facilities), backhaul demands (hauling debris after deliveries), distance limits, and time windows. The combination of these features corresponds to the OVRPBLTW variant.

Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 17
Description: A healthcare provider sends vans to deliver medical equipment and vaccines (linehaul) to remote clinics and collects blood samples or diagnostic specimens (backhaul) for laboratory analysis. Each van has a limited capacity to accommodate both supplies and perishable biological materials. Deliveries must arrive before clinics’ operational hours end (time windows), and pickups follow to ensure samples are retrieved promptly. Routes are restricted by distance limits to avoid delays in rural areas with poor infrastructure. The objective is to balance load constraints, time windows, and route feasibility to maximize service efficiency.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as blood samples are collected after deliveries, distance limits (L) due to rural infrastructure, and time windows (TW) for both deliveries and pickups. Since backhaul must follow linehaul (not mixed), all three constraints (B, L, TW) are present, and there is no indication of open routes (O) or mixed backhaul (MB). Thus, 'VRPBLTW' is the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 29
Description: A medical rental service delivers mobility aids like wheelchairs to patients’ homes (linehaul) by their scheduled therapy times (TW) and collects them after use (backhaul). Each delivery and pickup has time windows based on patient availability. Vehicles must carry both equipment and returned items within capacity limits. The objective is optimized routes for timely service and efficient capacity use.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) with time windows (TW) for each, and the vehicles can handle both tasks simultaneously (mixed backhaul, MB). Capacity constraints are present but secondary to MB and TW. There is no mention of open routes (O) or distance limits (L), so VRPMBTW is the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 29
Description: A city deploys technician teams to calibrate temporary traffic sensors before major events. Vans (capacity <capacity> sensors) start at the DOT yard (<loc_depot>), delivering new sensors (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieving expired ones (<demand_backhaul>) at intersections (<loc_customer>). Calibration must occur during low-traffic windows (<time_windows>). Routes respect daily overtime limits (<time_limit> hours), with vans parked near last job sites.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vans do not return to the depot, mixed backhaul (MB) since both linehaul and backhaul demands are handled at the same locations without strict order, and time window constraints (TW) for calibration. Capacity is mentioned but overridden by the presence of O, MB, and TW. The overtime limit is a time-based constraint but does not align with 'L' (distance limit). Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 97
Description: An IT services company must deploy mobile Wi-Fi hotspots to various festival venues (<loc_customer>) from a central warehouse (<loc_depot>). Each truck carries equipment (<capacity> units) and has 6-hour deployment windows (<time_windows>) before events begin. Technicians both install routers (linehaul) and later retrieve them (backhaul), with operations potentially mixed at multi-day events. Vehicles cannot exceed 200km daily routes (<distance_limit>) due to maintenance requirements. The goal is to service all venues while optimizing equipment transfers and minimizing fleet mileage.
Reason: The problem involves Mixed Backhaul (MB) as technicians handle both linehaul and backhaul operations simultaneously, distance limits (L) of 200km, and time windows (TW) for deployment. These elements correspond to the 'MB', 'L', and 'TW' attributes, making VRPMBLTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 7
Description: A manufacturing supplier services <num_customer> factories (<loc_customer>) from a distribution center (<loc_depot>). Vehicles deliver custom parts (<demand_linehaul>) and collect scrap metal (<demand_backhaul>) in any order, constrained by vehicle capacity (<capacity>). Factories impose strict time windows (<time_windows>) for deliveries to synchronize with production schedules. Routes must also respect a maximum duration (<time_limit>) to ensure driver shifts comply with labor laws. The aim is to reduce idle time at factories while optimizing fuel costs.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) since both linehaul and backhaul can be satisfied in any order, time windows (TW) for deliveries, and vehicle capacity. While there is a maximum route duration, this is not explicitly part of the provided acronym definitions. The presence of MB and TW makes 'VRPMBTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 91
Description: A production company must set up temporary stages for a multi-city music festival. Trucks deliver sound systems, lighting rigs, and backdrops (linehaul) to venues with setup time windows aligned with crew availability. After performances, they collect equipment (backhaul) without delaying cleanup crews. Each route must finish within an 10-hour shift (duration limit), and trucks cannot overload with mixed delivery/pickup loads. The goal is to minimize travel distance while respecting venue schedules and vehicle capacities.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) where equipment must be collected after deliveries, time windows (TW) aligned with crew availability, and no mixed loads (distinct linehaul and backhaul phases). The 10-hour shift constraint is a route duration limit, but the definitions provided associate 'L' with distance limits, which are not mentioned. Thus, the relevant features are B and TW, leading to VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 12
Description: An electronics retailer delivers new devices to customers’ homes (<loc_customer>) and collects outdated electronics for recycling. Deliveries must precede pickups to ensure customers receive their new items before returning old ones. Delivery vehicles have a limited capacity (<capacity>) to carry both new products and returned devices. Each customer specifies a time window (<time_windows>) for service: deliveries must occur during daytime hours (e.g., 9 AM–5 PM), while pickups are scheduled after the customer confirms receipt of the new item. The goal is to plan routes that meet all time constraints, prevent overloading vehicles, and ensure pickups follow deliveries.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW) for deliveries and requires pickups to occur after their corresponding deliveries, indicating a mixed backhaul (MB) scenario where linehaul and backhaul can be interleaved per customer. This aligns with VRPMBTW, which combines mixed backhaul and time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 98
Description: A city’s maintenance team delivers gardening tools, fertilizers, and equipment to city parks (linehaul) and collects litter and debris from designated areas (backhaul). Deliveries must precede pickups to avoid contamination. Vehicles have limited capacity, and routes are restricted by a distance limit to reduce fuel costs. The challenge is to optimize paths for servicing all parks efficiently while ensuring no vehicle exceeds its range or load capacity.
Reason: The problem includes backhaul demands (B) where deliveries must precede pickups, and distance limits (L) on vehicle routes. These constraints align with the VRPBL variant which combines backhaul and distance-limited requirements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 19
Description: An agricultural logistics firm delivers farming equipment (tractors, harvesters) to rural farms (linehaul) and collects harvested crops (backhaul) for processing. Vehicles must deliver machinery before the harvest window (time constraints) and then collect crops immediately after. Each truck has a capacity limit for both equipment and crop loads. Routes are restricted by distance to ensure accessibility in remote areas. The challenge is to synchronize deliveries and pickups, ensuring farmers can begin harvesting promptly and crops are retrieved before spoilage, while respecting operational limits.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) with linehaul deliveries followed by backhaul pickups, distance limits (L) due to route accessibility restrictions, and time window constraints (TW) for delivering before the harvest window and collecting immediately after. The presence of B, L, and TW makes VRPBLTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 96
Description: A vertical farming startup needs to distribute freshly harvested produce from their urban farm (<loc_depot>) to grocery stores (<loc_customer>) using refrigerated vans (<capacity> kg). Each store has strict delivery windows (<time_windows>) when staff are available to receive perishable items, and some locations require empty packaging to be collected (backhaul) for reuse. Vans may alternate between deliveries and pickups as needed. Routes must complete within 8-hour shifts (<duration_limit>) to ensure produce freshness, while respecting both capacity constraints and the mixed sequence of delivery/pickup operations.
Reason: The problem includes time windows (<time_windows>) at customer locations, mixed backhaul (pickups can occur alongside deliveries), and capacity constraints. Since the problem allows alternating between deliveries and pickups (mixed backhaul), requires adherence to time windows, and includes capacity, the most specific variant is VRPMBTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows). The duration limit (<duration_limit>) is a global constraint but does not correspond to a specific letter in the variant definitions provided, and "O" (open route) is not explicitly mentioned as routes may still return to the depot.

Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 98
Description: A wedding planning company transports floral arrangements, seating, and decor to venues before ceremonies, with strict setup time windows. After events, all items must be collected. Vehicles must deliver decor (linehaul) within time constraints, then return later to pick up items (backhaul), ensuring deliveries precede pickups. Capacity limits and timing are critical to avoid delays and logistical bottlenecks.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (B) where deliveries must precede pickups and time window (TW) constraints for deliveries and pickups. There is no mention of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhauls (MB). Capacity is mentioned but secondary to B and TW. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.

Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 99
Description: A university logistics team delivers scientific equipment, lab supplies, and chemicals to research facilities (linehaul) and collects expired or hazardous materials for disposal. Vehicles must first deliver items before retrieving waste. Each vehicle has a strict capacity limit, and routes must not exceed a predefined distance to avoid lengthy return trips. The goal is to plan routes that efficiently service all labs while adhering to safety and operational constraints.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) that must be serviced after linehaul deliveries, as well as distance limits (L) on routes. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O), and capacity (C) is superseded by the presence of B and L. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 35
Description: A county library system operates mobile units that deliver requested books to community hubs (e.g., senior centers, schools) while simultaneously collecting overdue returns. Each vehicle (capacity <capacity>) must visit <num_customer> locations (<loc_customer>) with delivery demands (<demand_linehaul>) and pickup quantities (<demand_backhaul>). Hubs have strict operating hours (<time_windows>) for visits, and each stop requires <service_time> for inventory processing. Routes must optimize the sequence of deliveries and pickups while respecting vehicle capacity and temporal constraints at each stop.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles handling both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) simultaneously (MB), hubs with strict operating hours (TW), and there is no mention of vehicles needing to return to the depot, implying open routes (O). Capacity is present but secondary to these features. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 43
Description: An education nonprofit transports portable computer labs to underserved schools (<loc_customer>), delivering equipment (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting completed student projects (<demand_backhaul>) for exhibitions. Vans with capacity <capacity> depart from the tech center (<loc_depot>) and must complete all stops within <distance_limit> miles due to perishable science experiment components. The flexible routing allows any combination of drop-offs and pickups while ensuring no van is overloaded and all educational materials reach their destinations fresh.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as both linehaul and backhaul demands can be satisfied simultaneously, distance limits (L) due to the perishable components requiring all stops to be completed within a mileage constraint, and vehicles do not explicitly need to return to the depot (though this is not directly stated, the distance limit implies a closed route). Time windows (TW) and open routes (O) are not mentioned. The presence of MB and L makes VRPMBL the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 78
Description: A film production company is shooting in rugged mountainous terrain. Each day, trucks must deliver cameras, lighting rigs, and set props (<demand_linehaul>) to filming locations (<loc_customer>). After setup, they collect used props, discarded materials, and equipment for reuse or disposal (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles have a limited capacity (<capacity>) to handle both deliveries and pickups. The mountainous roads impose a strict distance limit (<distance_limit>) on routes to prevent exceeding fuel reserves, as the nearest refueling station is hours away. The goal is to optimize routes so crews receive everything needed while efficiently repatriating waste without overloading trucks or straying beyond safe travel distances.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands at the same locations (filming locations), which requires handling mixed backhaul ('MB'). Additionally, vehicles are constrained by a strict distance limit ('L') due to mountainous terrain. Capacity ('C') is present but superseded by 'MB' and 'L'. There is no mention of time windows ('TW') or open routes ('O'), so the most specific variant is VRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 87
Description: Following a major earthquake, construction crews must deliver reinforced steel beams and concrete additives to damaged urban areas. Each site (<loc_customer>) has a time window (<time_windows>) for material arrival to align with reconstruction schedules. Heavy-duty trucks (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a regional depot (<loc_depot>), but mountainous terrain limits their travel range (<distance_limit> km). Routes must prioritize timely delivery while avoiding overloading and ensuring no truck exceeds its maximum journey distance.
Reason: The problem specifies time windows (<time_windows>) for delivery, distance limits (<distance_limit> km) due to mountainous terrain, and vehicle capacity (<capacity> ton). According to the definitions, when features like "L" (distance limits) and "TW" (time windows) are present, they take precedence over "C". There is no mention of backhaul (B/MB) or open routes (O). Thus, the most specific variant is VRP with distance limits and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 95
Description: A preservation organization must deliver conservation tools, materials, and protective gear to remote archaeological sites scattered across a mountainous region. After completing deliveries (linehaul), vehicles must collect damaged artifacts for restoration at a central museum. Each vehicle has a maximum capacity, and routes must not exceed a strict distance limit to ensure safe operation without refueling. The goal is to plan efficient routes that first service all sites with supplies before retrieving artifacts, ensuring no vehicle overloads or exceeds its travel range.
Reason: The problem requires vehicles to first service all linehaul (delivery) demands before collecting backhaul (artifact retrieval) demands, indicating a Backhaul (B) constraint. Additionally, vehicles have strict distance limits (L) that must not be exceeded. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O). The capacity constraint (C) is present but is superseded by the presence of B and L. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBL.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 95
Description: A green energy company operates a fleet of mobile electric vehicle charging trucks that must visit parking lots (<loc_customer>) across the city to provide on-demand charging services. Each truck has a battery capacity (<capacity> kWh) and can service multiple locations before needing to recharge at the central depot (<loc_depot>). Parking lots have specific time windows (<time_windows>) when charging is needed (e.g., office lots during work hours, residential areas overnight). The trucks can both deliver charge (linehaul) and collect payment data (backhaul) at each stop in any order. Routes must respect vehicle capacity, maximum shift duration (<duration_limit> hours), and time windows while minimizing total distance traveled.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as trucks can service linehaul (deliver charge) and backhaul (collect data) in any order, time windows (TW) for parking lots, and vehicle capacity. The shift duration is a time constraint but does not correspond to distance limits (L). The vehicles return to the depot, so O is not required. Hence, the most specific variant is VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 90
Description: A specialty photography service uses lightproof vans (capacity <capacity> kg) to distribute unexposed film (<demand_linehaul>) to professional studios (<loc_customer>) while collecting exposed reels (<demand_backhaul>) for processing at the central lab (<loc_depot>). Routes cannot exceed <distance_limit> km to maintain temperature control. The time-sensitive nature requires optimal sequencing of deliveries and pickups without exceeding vehicle capacity.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) where exposed reels are collected after delivering unexposed film, distance limits (L) to maintain temperature control, and vehicle capacity constraints. Since B and L are explicitly mentioned and there is no indication of open routes (O), time windows (TW), or mixed backhauls (MB), the most specific variant is VRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: CVRP, Predicted: OVRP, Index: 81
Description: A renewable energy company operates offshore wind farms and must deliver maintenance supplies (e.g., lubricants, turbine blades, and electrical components) from a coastal depot to each turbine site. Each wind turbine requires specific parts, and the delivery vessels have limited cargo space. Routes must be planned to service all turbines efficiently, ensuring no vessel exceeds its capacity, while minimizing fuel consumption and operational costs. The challenge includes navigating marine routes and reaching remote offshore locations.
Reason: The problem involves delivering goods from a depot to turbines without an explicit requirement for vessels to return to the depot, indicating an open route (O). While capacity constraints (C) exist, the presence of O takes precedence. No backhaul (B), time windows (TW), or distance limits (L) are explicitly mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRP.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 69
Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile clinics (capacity: <capacity> test kits/supplies) from a warehouse (<loc_depot>) to conduct tests at community centers (<loc_customer>) and redistribute surplus PPE to underserved clinics. Testing sites have appointment-based time windows (<time_windows>), and vehicles must return within shift limits (<time_limit>). Routes must efficiently combine testing (linehaul) and supply redistribution (backhaul) without exceeding cargo limits.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (testing) and backhaul (PPE redistribution) with time windows for the testing sites (<time_windows>). Since backhaul (B) requires linehaul to be completed first and time windows (TW) are present, the variant is VRPBTW. The shift limit (<time_limit>) is a route duration constraint, which is implicitly handled under TW in this context, and there is no indication of mixed backhaul (MB) or open routes (O).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 89
Description: A veterinary service delivers mobile clinics to livestock farms for scheduled health checkups and retrieves them afterward. Each farm has an appointment time window for the clinic’s visit. Delivery vehicles (<capacity> capacity) must first deliver clinic equipment and then collect waste materials and used supplies during pickup. The route must ensure all farms are serviced within their time slots without overloading trucks, balancing animal care needs with logistical efficiency.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles delivering clinic equipment (linehaul) and collecting waste (backhaul) at the same farms. Since backhaul operations (pickup) occur immediately after linehaul (delivery) at each farm during the same visit, this aligns with the 'Mixed Backhaul (MB)' condition, which allows interleaving linehaul and backhaul as long as delivery precedes pickup. Additionally, farms have time window constraints (TW). Capacity is mentioned but secondary to MB and TW. No open routes (O) or distance limits (L) are specified. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 92
Description: A renewable energy firm services offshore wind turbines by delivering repair kits (linehaul) and hauling away decommissioned turbine blades (backhaul). Maintenance must occur during tidal windows (time constraints) to access restricted zones, and vessels must return to port within 14 hours (duration limit) due to crew safety regulations. Each boat has limited capacity for both new parts and scrap materials, requiring precise load balancing.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) due to simultaneous linehaul and backhaul demands at turbines, time windows (TW) for tidal access constraints, and a maximum route duration (implied via the 14-hour return limit, which is captured under TW as depot time window constraints). Capacity constraints are present but ignored due to the presence of MB and TW.

Description: A solar energy company is installing panels in a remote desert region. Heavy equipment and materials must be transported from the central depot (<loc_depot>) to installation sites at <loc_customer>. Each truck can carry up to <capacity> kg of equipment, and desert terrain limits daily travel to <distance_limit> km to avoid mechanical failure. Sites require <demand> kg of materials. Optimize routes to ensure all sites are supplied without exceeding vehicle capacities or daily distance limits.
Reason: The problem specifies distance limits (L) and does not mention vehicles returning to the depot, suggesting open routes (O). Capacity is present but superseded by O and L. No backhaul, time windows, or mixed backhaul are mentioned.

Description: In a riverine community, boats (capacity: <capacity> kg) distribute fresh produce (<demand_linehaul>) to floating vendors (<loc_customer>) and collect organic waste (<demand_backhaul>) for composting. Starting from the riverside depot (<loc_depot>), routes must navigate waterways efficiently with <distance_limit> constraints due to fuel scarcity. Mixed sequencing accommodates tidal market schedules.
Reason: The problem involves mixed sequencing of linehaul and backhaul (MB), distance limits (L), and tidal schedules implying time windows (TW). Mixed backhaul (MB) allows simultaneous handling of both demands, distance constraints (L) are specified, and tidal schedules suggest time-related access (TW).

Description: A polar research organization must deliver supplies (<demand>) to isolated Arctic stations (<loc_customer>) during narrow seasonal ice-free windows (<time_windows>). Cargo planes (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a base (<loc_depot>), but must return before fuel depletion (<distance_limit> km). Critical supplies like food and equipment must be delivered before winter sets in, requiring precise timing to avoid trapping crews in extreme conditions.
Reason: The problem involves both distance limits (L) due to fuel constraints and time windows (TW) for the ice-free periods. The vehicles must return to the depot (not open route), and there is no mention of backhaul (B) or mixed backhaul (MB) demands. Capacity (C) is present but superseded by the L and TW constraints.

Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 77
Description: A sports league operator delivers sports equipment to stadiums before games and collects it post-event. Each venue has strict time windows for setup and teardown. Delivery trucks must first distribute gear (linehaul) to all locations, then return to collect the equipment (backhaul). Capacity constraints limit the number of items per truck, and routes are restricted to a maximum distance to cover multiple venues efficiently. All deliveries must precede game starts, and pickups must align with post-game cleanup schedules.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) where equipment must be collected after all deliveries are completed, distance limits (L) on routes, and time windows (TW) for both deliveries and pickups. These features align with the VRPBLTW variant, which explicitly includes backhaul, distance constraints, and time windows. The absence of open routes (O) or mixed backhaul (MB) further confirms this choice.

Description: An indoor farming company coordinates daily harvests from rooftop greenhouses while delivering new seed stock. Trucks depart from a distribution center (<loc_depot>) with seed packages (<demand_linehaul>) and collect harvested produce (<demand_backhaul>) from urban farms (<loc_customer>). Each electric vehicle has battery-limited range (<distance_limit>) and weight capacity (<capacity>). Routes may alternate deliveries and pickups based on farm readiness schedules.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as deliveries and pickups can alternate, distance limits (L) due to battery range, and time windows (TW) implied by farm readiness schedules. These elements correspond to the VRPMBLTW variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 78
Description: A recycling firm delivers empty bins to businesses and collects filled ones weekly. Each client specifies time windows for deliveries and pickups. Trucks must first distribute empty bins (linehaul) before returning to collect the waste (backhaul). Capacity limits depend on bin sizes, and routes cannot exceed a distance threshold to ensure same-day service. The company must coordinate deliveries and pickups to meet business schedules without overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW) for deliveries and pickups, backhaul (B) demands that must be addressed after linehaul, and route distance limits (L). These features align with the VRPBLTW variant, which explicitly combines backhaul, distance constraints, and time windows. The requirement to complete linehaul before backhaul (not mixed) and the presence of all three attributes (B, L, TW) make VRPBLTW the most specific match.

Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 2
Description: A furniture retailer operates a "trade-in" program where customers receive new furniture deliveries (<demand_linehaul>) and simultaneously have old furniture picked up (<demand_backhaul>). Delivery trucks start from the main warehouse (<loc_depot>), first delivering new items to households, then collecting discarded furniture from other customers. The trucks must never exceed their weight capacity (<capacity>), and pickups can only occur after all deliveries on the route are finalized. The challenge is to balance load distribution and route efficiency to reduce total driving distance while ensuring timely service for both delivery and recycling requests.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (B) that can only be addressed after all linehaul deliveries are completed, and capacity constraints (C) are present. However, since the presence of B supersedes C according to the problem definition guidelines, the most specific variant is VRPB. There is no mention of time windows (TW), distance limits (L), or open routes (O), so these are excluded.

Supply ships depart from a coastal depot, ending routes at the last vessel without returning. Capacity (C) accommodates both supplies and sample storage. Distance limits (L) are critical to prevent fuel shortages in open waters, ensuring timely service while adhering to strict logistical constraints.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as ships do not return to the depot, mixed backhaul (MB) since both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (sample collection) occur during the same trip (capacity accommodates both), and distance limits (L) to prevent fuel shortages. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBL.

Wait, hold on. The previous thought process concluded VRPMBTW, but the answer here is VRPMBLTW. Let me check again. The problem mentions a maximum shift duration. The code definitions say 'L' is distance limits, but the problem's time_limit is a time constraint, not distance. However, the available codes don't have a 'T' for time limits. The user's list includes 'L' as distance limits. So the maximum shift duration (time) isn't covered by any code provided. Therefore, the 'L' code (distance limits) isn't applicable here. Therefore, the correct variant should be VRPMBTW. However, the answer given was VRPMBLTW. Did I make a mistake here?

Ah, perhaps the maximum shift duration is considered under the 'time_limit', which might be considered as a route duration constraint. In some VRP variants, route duration limits are part of the problem even if not explicitly mentioned in the code. But according to the user's definitions, 'L' is for distance limits. So the shift duration (time) is not covered by 'L'. Therefore, including 'L' in the code would be incorrect. So the correct variant should be VRPMBTW. But the answer given was VRPMBLTW. That suggests that 'L' was included, perhaps mistakenly. 

Wait, in the user's problem description: "Routes are constrained by a maximum shift duration (<time_limit>) to comply with labor laws." So maximum shift duration is a time limit. The available codes don't have a specific code for time duration limits. The 'TW' is for time windows. The problem has both time windows (for service at locations) and a maximum route duration (shift duration). Since there's no code for route duration, but 'L' is distance, which isn't the case here, perhaps the answer should not include 'L'. Therefore, the correct code is VRPMBTW. But in the initial answer, I included 'L', which was a mistake.

So the correct answer should be VRPMBTW. But let's check the options again. The list includes 'VRPMBLTW' which has L (distance) and TW (time windows). But the problem doesn't mention distance limits. The shift duration is time, not distance. So 'L' is not applicable here. So the correct code is VRPMBTW. However, looking at the list provided, 'VRPMBTW' is an option, yes. But the user's options include 'VRPMBLTW' but also 'VRPMBTW'. Therefore, the correct code should be VRPMBTW. The initial answer mistakenly included 'L' (distance limit) which is not present. Therefore, the correct JSON should have 'VRPMBTW' as the result.

But in the initial answer, the assistant selected 'VRPMBLTW' which is incorrect. So the correct answer should be 'VRPMBTW'. Let's redo the answer correctly.

Reason: The problem specifies open routes (O) where vehicles do not return to the depot, backhaul demand (B) for retrieving artworks alongside linehaul deliveries, and a distance limit (L) to minimize vibration damage. This combination of features corresponds to the 'OVRPBL' variant, which includes open routes, backhaul, and distance constraints.

Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 94
Description: A yacht manufacturer must transport newly built luxury yachts from its shipyard (<loc_depot>) to <num_customer> coastal ports (<loc_customer>) for client deliveries. Each port has a time window (<time_windows>) when it can accept the yacht due to tidal restrictions and scheduling, with a service time (<service_time>) for docking and inspection. Transport barges (<capacity>) can carry only one yacht at a time and must adhere to a distance limit (<distance_limit>) to avoid extended voyages. The challenge is to plan routes that align with port schedules while minimizing total travel time and ensuring yachts arrive before clients cancel due to delays.
Reason: The problem includes time windows (TW) at the coastal ports, distance limits (L) for the barges, and does not explicitly require the barges to return to the depot after deliveries, suggesting an open route (O). These features correspond to the OVRPLTW variant, which combines open routes, distance limits, and time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 59
Description: A fleet of food trucks rotates locations daily, operating at different urban spots with assigned time slots (e.g., Truck A at Park X from 12:00 PM–2:00 PM, Truck B at Plaza Y from 5:00 PM–7:00 PM). A central depot must deliver fresh ingredients to each truck’s temporary location within their operating hours. Delivery vehicles have limited refrigerated capacity and must plan routes under a daily distance limit to service all trucks efficiently without exceeding driver shift durations.
Reason: The problem specifies time windows (TW) for deliveries during operating hours, distance limits (L) for delivery vehicles, and open routes (O) as there is no mention of returning to the depot. Capacity (C) is present but superseded by other constraints. No backhaul (B) or mixed backhaul (MB) is mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 31
Description: Researchers deploy buoys with sensors (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieve damaged units (<demand_backhaul>) across coastal sites (<loc_customer>) using boats departing from a harbor (<loc_depot>). Each boat has limited cargo space (<capacity>) and must complete its route within <distance_limit> nautical miles due to fuel constraints. Tide-dependent time windows (<time_windows>) dictate when buoys can be installed/removed at each site. Boats remain at their final location for overnight monitoring.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as boats do not return to the depot, backhaul demands (B) for retrieving damaged units, distance limits (L) due to fuel constraints, and time windows (TW) for tide-dependent service. This combination of attributes aligns with the OVRPBLTW variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 39
Description: A health organization needs to deliver temperature-sensitive vaccines to rural clinics, each with a specific delivery time window (TW) to ensure they can be administered immediately. Vaccines must be kept at precise temperatures (cold chain), so delivery trucks have limited capacity (C) for refrigerated units. Routes must be completed within a maximum distance (L) to prevent delays and maintain vaccine efficacy. The task is to design routes that meet all clinics’ time windows, adhere to truck capacity and route distance constraints, while minimizing travel costs and ensuring vaccine integrity.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (TW) for deliveries and maximum route distance constraints (L). While capacity (C) is mentioned, according to the problem classification rules, when other attributes like TW or L are present, they take precedence over C. The problem does not mention backhaul (B), open routes (O), or mixed backhaul (MB), so the most specific variant combining distance limits and time windows is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 25
Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile testing units to conduct COVID-19 tests at designated sites (<loc_customer>). Each unit starts from a central lab (<loc_depot>) with a capacity of <capacity> test kits and must collect swab samples (<demand_backhaul>) while delivering fresh testing supplies (<demand_linehaul>). Routes must be optimized to ensure:  
- Units never exceed their kit/sample capacity.  
- Testing and sample collection can occur in any order (e.g., a unit might pick up samples before delivering more kits).  
- Total travel distance per unit stays under <distance_limit> km to maintain testing schedules.
Reason: The problem requires handling both linehaul (delivering test kits) and backhaul (collecting samples) in any order (Mixed Backhaul, MB), has distance limits (L) per unit, and does not explicitly require vehicles to return to the depot (Open route, O). The presence of these attributes (O, MB, L) makes OVRPMBL the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 23
Description: A staffing agency transports temporary workers to event venues (linehaul) and retrieves them post-shift (backhaul). Workers must arrive at venues precisely during setup windows (<time_windows>), and pickups occur after events end. Buses (<capacity> passengers) cannot operate beyond a 10-hour daily limit (<duration_limit>). Routes must prioritize venue drop-offs before staff pickups, avoiding overtime penalties while minimizing idle time between stops.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as workers must be picked up after their shifts (post-linehaul), time windows (TW) for drop-offs, and buses have a capacity (C). However, since TW and B are present, they take precedence over C. The duration limit (<duration_limit>) is a time-based constraint, but the provided definitions associate "L" with distance limits, not duration, so "L" is excluded. The problem does not mention open routes (O) or mixed backhauls (MB). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 11
Description: A coastal environmental agency uses research vessels to deploy scientific instruments (linehaul) to <num_customer> marine monitoring stations (<loc_customer>) and later collect plastic waste (backhaul) from polluted beaches. Each vessel has a <capacity> ton capacity for equipment and waste. The equipment deployment phase must occur before waste collection to avoid contamination of scientific gear. Vessels must also adhere to a <distance_limit> nautical mile limit to ensure safe return to the base port (<loc_depot>) without refueling. The challenge is optimizing routes to cover all stations and cleanup sites efficiently while balancing cargo weight and avoiding overreach of travel limits.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) with linehaul preceding backhaul, distance limits (L), and requires returning to the depot (non-open route). There are no time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 75
Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile testing and vaccination units that must visit multiple locations (<loc_customer>) from a central depot (<loc_depot>). Each vehicle has limited medical supplies (<capacity>) and must complete its route within a strict duration limit (<time_limit>) due to vaccine temperature constraints. Some stops require testing (pickups of samples) while others require vaccine delivery (drop-offs), which can be sequenced flexibly. Each location has specific time windows (<time_windows>) for service based on appointment schedules, and technicians must wait if arriving early. The goal is to maximize served populations while minimizing total distance traveled.
Reason: The problem involves vehicles with capacity constraints (C), mixed backhaul (MB) as stops require both pickups and drop-offs that can be sequenced flexibly, and time window constraints (TW) at locations. The strict duration limit is a route-level constraint but does not correspond directly to "L" (distance limit). Since MB and TW are present, they override the base CVRP classification, leading to VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 33
Description: A wildlife organization conducts health checks (delivering medicines: <demand_linehaul>) and transports lab samples (<demand_backhaul>) across sanctuaries (<loc_customer>) using mobile clinics. Vehicles (capacity <capacity>) start at headquarters (<loc_depot>) with <distance_limit> range limits due to refrigeration needs. Time windows (<time_windows>) align with animal feeding schedules. Teams overnight at their final sanctuary location.
Reason: The problem involves an open route (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, backhaul demand (B) for lab samples alongside linehaul demand for medicines, distance limits (L) due to refrigeration constraints, and time window (TW) requirements aligned with feeding schedules. These features collectively match the 'OVRPBLTW' variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 60
Description: A fleet of service vehicles operates in a metropolitan area to replace depleted electric vehicle (EV) batteries with fully charged ones at designated swap stations (<loc_customer>). Each station has both a demand for fresh batteries (<demand_linehaul>) and a supply of depleted ones (<demand_backhaul>). Service trucks (<capacity>) depart from a central depot (<loc_depot>) and must visit stations in any order, ensuring:  
- Total battery load (fresh + depleted) never exceeds truck capacity  
- Each route stays within a <distance_limit> km range due to operational shift constraints  
- All stations receive fresh batteries and have depleted units collected
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vehicles do not need to return to the depot, implied by 'depart from a central depot' without return requirement), mixed backhaul (both linehaul and backhaul demands are present and can be satisfied in any order, as stations require fresh batteries and depleted ones are collected without sequencing constraints), and distance limits (routes must stay within <distance_limit> km). These correspond to 'O', 'MB', and 'L' attributes, making 'OVRPMBL' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 14
Description: A studio manages daily equipment rentals to shooting locations (linehaul) and retrieves gear from wrap sites (backhaul). Vehicles (<capacity>) follow flexible sequences to accommodate filming schedules (<time_windows>). Routes are capped at <time_limit> hours due to union rules. The equipment depot (<loc_depot>) coordinates with 25 active sets (<loc_customer>), each with unique load/unload times (<service_time>).
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as vehicles handle both linehaul and backhaul in flexible sequences, and time windows (TW) are specified for filming schedules. The route time limit is a union constraint but 'L' refers to distance limits, which are not mentioned. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 36
Description: A floral distributor delivers fresh bouquets to grocery stores and flower shops daily, with strict time windows to maintain freshness. Each stop requires a <demand_linehaul> kg delivery of flowers and a <demand_backhaul> kg pickup of empty crates for reuse. Trucks cannot exceed <capacity> kg total load (flowers + crates) and must return to the depot within a <distance_limit> km range to ensure overnight restocking. Time windows align with store opening hours, demanding precise routing to avoid late deliveries or missed crate pickups.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as each stop has both linehaul and backhaul demands, distance limits (L) to ensure trucks return within range, and time window constraints (TW) for deliveries and pickups. These features correspond to the 'MB', 'L', and 'TW' attributes, making 'VRPMBLTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 40
Description: A fleet of mobile electric vehicle (EV) charging trucks operates across a metropolitan area, providing on-demand charging services to stranded EVs while simultaneously collecting depleted batteries for recycling. Each truck has a limited battery capacity (<capacity> kWh) and must visit customers (<loc_customer>) within strict time windows (<time_windows>) when drivers are available. The service involves both delivering charge (linehaul) and collecting old batteries (backhaul) in any order, with routes constrained by maximum shift durations (<time_limit> hours).
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as both linehaul and backhaul can be satisfied in any order, time windows (TW) due to strict customer availability constraints, and capacity (C) is mentioned but overridden by MB and TW. There is no mention of open routes (O) or distance limits (L). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 99
Description: A semiconductor factory requires precise deliveries of chemicals and substrates (linehaul) to production bays within strict time windows to maintain schedules. Post-processing, hazardous waste must be collected (backhaul) and returned to the depot. Vehicles must ensure deliveries occur before pickups, stay within capacity limits, and adhere to time windows to prevent production delays. Routes end at the depot after waste retrieval, optimizing efficiency without mandatory returns.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands with a requirement that deliveries (linehaul) must be completed before pickups (backhaul), indicating backhaul (B) constraints. Additionally, strict time windows (TW) are specified for deliveries. Although vehicles return to the depot after backhaul, the description emphasizes optimizing routes "without mandatory returns," which aligns with open routes (O). However, since the final route explicitly ends at the depot, the open route (O) classification does not apply. The combination of backhaul and time windows (B + TW) makes VRPBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 21
Description: A catering company delivers hot meals to corporate events (<demand_linehaul>) and collects uneaten portions (<demand_backhaul>) for donation or composting. Meals must be delivered within 30 minutes of event start times (<time_windows>), while pickups occur after events conclude. Each vehicle (capacity <capacity> meals) has a 6-hour operating window (<duration_limit>). The goal is to optimize routes so meal deliveries precede pickups, prevent temperature breaches, and ensure timely service without overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (B) with separate linehaul and backhaul demands that must be sequenced (deliveries before pickups) and time windows (TW) for deliveries and pickups. The capacity constraint is present but superseded by B and TW. The 6-hour operating window is considered part of the time constraints. No mixed backhaul (MB), distance limits (L), or open routes (O) are mentioned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPB, Predicted: VRPB, Index: 16
Description: A research supply company delivers specialized lab equipment to remote research facilities and collects hazardous biological or chemical samples for analysis. Each van (capacity <capacity>) departs from the central lab (<loc_depot>), first delivering equipment to remote sites, then collecting samples from those same locations. The backhaul phase must occur only after all deliveries are finalized to avoid contamination or equipment damage. The goal is to minimize travel distance while ensuring sample integrity and adherence to safety protocols.
Reason: The problem requires backhaul operations (collecting samples) to occur only after all deliveries (linehaul) are completed, which aligns with the VRPB variant that enforces backhaul demand to be satisfied after linehaul demand. There are no mentions of time windows, distance limits, or open routes, making VRPB the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 74
Description: A farm services company delivers pesticides (linehaul) to rural farms during planting windows (TW) and collects empty containers (backhaul) for recycling. Trucks (C) must handle hazardous materials carefully, adhering to strict capacity limits. Routes are limited by distance (L) to cover remote areas efficiently. Drivers begin at the depot, supply pesticides, then retrieve containers, concluding at the depot for recycling—preventing environmental contamination and reducing travel redundancy.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as containers are collected after delivering pesticides, distance limits (L) due to remote areas, and time windows (TW) for planting windows. The trucks must return to the depot (excluding "O" variants), and there is no indication of mixed backhaul (MB). Thus, the most specific variant combining B, L, and TW is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 90
Description: A global satellite operator must deploy communication equipment to remote ground stations and retrieve outdated gear for recycling. Trucks depart from a central depot to deliver new equipment (linehaul) before collecting old units (backhaul) to avoid cross-contamination. Each site has strict installation and retrieval time windows tied to satellite orbital passes. Vehicles must complete routes within a 12-hour window (duration limit) to ensure daylight operations, and payloads cannot exceed truck capacities. The challenge is balancing equipment delivery with pickup schedules while adhering to tight operational timelines.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (B) where linehaul must be completed before backhaul to avoid cross-contamination, and time windows (TW) at each site tied to satellite passes. The 12-hour duration limit enforces route timing, but the primary constraints are backhaul sequencing and site-specific time windows. Capacity (C) is mentioned but superseded by B and TW. The depot requires vehicles to return, so "O" (open route) does not apply. The variant VRPBTW captures the critical backhaul and time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 49
Description: A municipal arborist service prunes trees (<loc_customer>) during neighborhood-approved time windows (<time_windows>) and collects branches for composting. Chipper trucks (capacity <capacity>) route dynamically—pruning some trees before collecting debris from others—while adhering to noise ordinance duration limits (<distance_limit>).
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as debris collection occurs after some pruning (linehaul), distance limits (L) due to noise ordinances, and time windows (TW) for neighborhood-approved service. These elements correspond to the VRPBLTW variant, which combines backhaul, distance limits, and time window constraints. There is no indication of mixed backhaul (MB) or open routes (O), so B, L, and TW are the dominant attributes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 28
Description: A fleet of maintenance drones (capacity <capacity>) services offshore solar farms, delivering cleaning fluid to panels (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieving full data loggers (<demand_backhaul>) from monitoring stations. Launching from a coastal base (<loc_depot>), routes must cover <num_customer> floating platforms (<loc_customer>) within <distance_limit> km due to battery limits. Drones land on charging stations at their final platform.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as drones end at their final platform and don't return to the depot, backhaul (B) demands (retrieving data loggers) that are separate from linehaul (delivering fluid), and distance limits (L) due to battery constraints. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or mixed backhaul (MB), so the most specific variant is OVRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 18
Description: A linen service company delivers fresh towels and bed linens (linehaul) to hotels and collects soiled laundry (backhaul) for washing. Vehicles must adhere to hotels’ specific time windows for deliveries (e.g., morning setup) and pickups (e.g., evening collection). Each truck has a capacity limit for both clean and dirty linens. Routes are constrained by distance to ensure drivers can complete their assigned stops within a shift without returning to the depot. The goal is to optimize delivery and pickup sequences to meet hotel schedules while avoiding overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, mixed backhauls (MB) since both deliveries (linehaul) and pickups (backhaul) can be sequenced flexibly based on time windows, distance limits (L) to ensure routes fit within a shift, and time windows (TW) for deliveries and pickups. These features collectively align with the OVRPMBLTW variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPTW, Index: 9
Description: A veterinary service operates mobile clinics visiting neighborhoods (<loc_customer>) to provide care (deliver medicines) and collect strays for shelters. Vans (capacity: <capacity>) start at the central clinic (<loc_depot>). Appointments have fixed time slots (<time_windows>). Vehicles remain in the field after final visits for emergency calls. Optimize routes to maximize animals served while adhering to capacity and clinic hours.
Reason: The problem specifies time windows (<time_windows>) and open routes (vehicles remain in the field after final visits, not returning to the depot). While capacity constraints exist, the presence of 'O' (open routes) and 'TW' (time windows) take precedence over 'C' in the classification. The correct variant is OVRPTW, combining open routes and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 23
Description: A fish farm supplies feed (<demand_linehaul>) to offshore aquaculture cages (<loc_customer>) and collects harvested fish (<demand_backhaul>) using boats (<capacity>). Trips from the port (<loc_depot>) must mix deliveries and pickups efficiently while adhering to a <distance_limit> nautical mile range due to fuel constraints. The goal is to serve all cages while minimizing total nautical miles traveled.
Reason: The problem involves mixed linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) which can be handled simultaneously (MB), a distance limit (L) due to fuel constraints, and open routes (O) as the description does not explicitly require boats to return to the depot. Time windows (TW) are not mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBL, combining Open VRP with Mixed Backhaul and distance Limits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 9
Description: A mobile library visits neighborhoods (<loc_customer>) to drop off reserved books (<demand_linehaul>) and collect donations (<demand_backhaul>). The bookmobile (capacity <capacity>) starts at the main library (<loc_depot>) but remains overnight at its final stop. Stops have 2-hour service windows (<time_windows>) for patron access. Daily routes are limited to <distance_limit> miles due to fuel constraints.
Reason: The problem involves an open route (O) as the vehicle does not return to the depot, backhaul demand (B) for collecting donations after linehaul deliveries, distance limits (L) due to fuel constraints, and time windows (TW) for service at stops. These features correspond to the OVRPBLTW variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 19
Description: A floral wholesaler supplies fresh arrangements (<demand_linehaul>) to wedding venues (<loc_customer>) during strict setup windows (<time_windows>), then returns post-event to:  
- Remove decorations (<demand_backhaul>)  
- Collect reusable materials  
Refrigerated trucks (<capacity>) must carefully sequence deliveries (morning) and pickups (evening) while preventing cross-contamination between fresh and used items, all within tight venue access time slots.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands (B) with the requirement to sequence deliveries before pickups, time window constraints (TW) for strict venue access, and capacity constraints. However, the presence of B and TW supersedes the capacity (C) in the classification. There is no mention of open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhauls (MB), making VRPBTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 34
Description: Municipal composting trucks (<capacity>) visit neighborhood drop-off points (<loc_customer>) to collect organic waste (<demand_backhaul>) and distribute processed fertilizer (<demand_linehaul>). Starting from a processing plant (<loc_depot>), routes must stay under <distance_limit> km due to odor containment requirements. The system optimizes simultaneous waste collection and fertilizer redistribution in a single trip.
Reason: The problem involves simultaneous handling of linehaul (fertilizer distribution) and backhaul (waste collection) demands, which corresponds to 'MB' (Mixed Backhaul). Additionally, there is a distance constraint ('L') due to odor containment requirements. No time windows ('TW') or open routes ('O') are mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant combining Mixed Backhaul and distance limits is VRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 20
Description: A national postal service must deliver packages to residential customers and collect returned items for redistribution. Delivery trucks (with <capacity> kg capacity) start and end at a central depot <loc_depot>. Linehaul stops (deliveries) must occur before backhaul stops (pickups). Each customer has a time window <time_windows> for service (e.g., daytime availability), and drivers cannot exceed an 8-hour shift (<duration_limit>). The challenge is to minimize route distances while ensuring all deliveries are completed before pickups and adhering to strict shift constraints.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) with a strict order (B), time window constraints at customer locations (TW), and vehicles must return to the depot (not open). While there is a shift duration limit, the provided variants do not explicitly include duration constraints, and "L" refers to distance limits, which are not mentioned. The combination of backhaul and time windows makes "VRPBTW" the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 28
Description: Field biologists service GPS collars on animals across a national park. Teams depart from ranger stations (<loc_depot>) with replacement batteries (<demand_linehaul>) and collect failed units (<demand_backhaul>). Strict time windows (<time_windows>) correspond to animal activity patterns. Vehicles (capacity <capacity> kg) have off-road range limits (<distance_limit> km) and remain at final sites for overnight camping.
Reason: The problem description includes open routes (vehicles remain at final sites, so they don't return to the depot), backhaul demands (collecting failed units after delivering batteries), distance limits (off-road range constraints), and time windows. The combination of O (open), B (backhaul), L (distance limit), and TW (time windows) makes 'OVRPBLTW' the most specific variant.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 3
Description: A farm coordinates trucks to transport harvested crops (`<demand_backhaul>`) from fields (`<loc_customer>`) to packing centers while delivering empty crates (`<demand_linehaul>`) for the next harvest. Trucks (capacity: `<capacity>`) start at the farm depot (`<loc_depot>`). Key constraints:  
- **Time windows** (`<time_windows>`): Crops must be picked up within 2 hours of harvesting to avoid spoilage.  
- **Duration limits** (`<distance_limit>`): Routes cannot exceed 5 hours due to driver regulations.  
- **Open routes**: Trucks stay at packing centers overnight.  
*Goal*: Optimize routes to reduce spoilage and fuel use.
Reason: The problem involves Open routes (trucks do not return to the depot), Backhaul (transporting harvested crops as backhaul after delivering empty crates as linehaul), distance Limits (route duration constraints), and Time Windows (crop pickup deadlines). These correspond to the 'O', 'B', 'L', and 'TW' attributes, making 'OVRPBLTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 85
Description: A luxury mobile laundry service operates a fleet of vans to deliver fresh linens to hotels (<loc_customer>) and collect soiled laundry for cleaning. Each van has a capacity of <capacity> kg and must complete routes within <time_limit> hours due to shift constraints. Hotels have strict delivery/pickup windows (<time_windows>) for minimal operational disruption. Vans start at the processing plant (<loc_depot>) but may end routes at any location after final service. The mixed nature allows alternating deliveries and pickups based on real-time needs.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (vans may end at any location after the final service), mixed backhauls (alternating deliveries and pickups are allowed without strict ordering), and time window constraints (strict delivery/pickup windows at hotels). Capacity is present but superseded by these features. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBTW (Open Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed Backhaul and Time Windows).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 24
Description: A disaster response team deploys rescue kits (<demand_linehaul>) to affected communities and retrieves used equipment (<demand_backhaul>) for restocking. Deployments must occur within critical 2-hour windows (<time_windows>) after crisis alerts, while pickups follow 24-hour post-deployment. Each vehicle (<capacity> gear units) has a 12-hour operational limit (<duration_limit>). The solution requires prioritizing urgent deliveries, ensuring return trips do not exceed time constraints, and managing fluctuating demand across disaster zones.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands (B) with specific time windows (TW) for deployments (2-hour windows) and pickups (24-hour post-deployment). The vehicles must return to the depot (not open route), and while there is a 12-hour operational duration limit, the provided variants define 'L' as distance limits, which is not explicitly mentioned here. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW, combining backhaul and time window constraints.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 94
Description: A cleanroom logistics team must transport fragile semiconductor wafers from a fabrication plant (<loc_depot>) to <num_customer> testing facilities (<loc_customer>), each requiring <demand_linehaul> wafers. Simultaneously, defective units (<demand_backhaul>) must be collected for recycling. Specialized vehicles (<capacity>) have a <distance_limit>-km range due to battery and contamination-control protocols. Routes must dynamically sequence deliveries and pickups while avoiding cross-contamination risks.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivering wafers) and backhaul (collecting defective units), with a strict requirement to avoid cross-contamination (implying backhaul after linehaul completion, aligning with 'B'). Additionally, vehicles have a distance limit ('L') due to battery and contamination protocols. There is no mention of open routes ('O'), mixed backhaul ('MB'), or time windows ('TW'), making 'VRPBL' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 83
Description: A healthcare startup uses drones to transport temperature-sensitive medical samples (<demand>) from hospitals (<loc_customer>) to a central lab (<loc_depot>). Each drone has a limited payload (<capacity> kg) and battery range (<distance_limit> km). Samples must arrive at the lab within strict time windows (<time_windows>) to ensure diagnostic accuracy. Routes must optimize flight paths to avoid delays while respecting energy constraints.
Reason: The problem includes distance limits (L) due to battery range constraints, time windows (TW) for sample arrival, and capacity (C). However, according to the guidelines, when other features like L and TW are present, C is ignored. Since the problem has both L and TW without any backhaul (B) or open routes (O), the most specific variant is VRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 88
Description: A tech company services edge data centers (<loc_customer>) by delivering charged coolant tanks (linehaul) and retrieving depleted ones (backhaul). Vehicles with <capacity> tank capacity must operate within <time_windows> to avoid server overheating. Each route is capped at <distance_limit> km due to coolant temperature maintenance requirements. Technicians start at the refrigeration plant (<loc_depot>) but may end routes at designated parking zones near high-priority sites.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles may end at parking zones, backhaul (B) due to retrieving depleted tanks, distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). The combination of these features corresponds to the OVRPBLTW variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description: A health agency deploys mobile clinics (capacity: `<capacity>`) from a hub (`<loc_depot>`) to administer vaccines (`<demand_linehaul>`) and collect used syringes (`<demand_backhaul>`) at `<num_customer>` neighborhoods (`<loc_customer>`). Challenges:  
- **Time windows** (`<time_windows>`): Clinics operate only during community-approved hours.  
- **Distance limits** (`<distance_limit>`): Clinics must return to the hub before vaccine coolers lose potency.  
- **Mixed sequencing**: A clinic might vaccinate at Stop 1, collect waste at Stop 2, then vaccinate at Stop 3.  
*Goal*: Maximize vaccinations/day while complying with safety constraints.
Reason: The problem includes Mixed Backhaul (MB) as clinics can alternate between vaccinations (linehaul) and waste collection (backhaul), Distance Limits (L) due to the need to return before coolers lose potency, and Time Windows (TW) from community-approved hours. Since the vehicles must return to the hub, it is not an Open Route (O). Thus, the most specific variant combining MB, L, and TW is VRPMBLTW.

Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 12
Description: An art logistics company transports exhibits to galleries (<loc_customer>) for temporary displays. Each gallery has a setup window (<time_windows>) and requires delivery (<demand_linehaul>) or pickup (<demand_backhaul>) of artworks (MB). Trucks (capacity <capacity>) start at a storage facility (<loc_depot>), follow open routes (O), and adhere to fuel-based distance limits (<distance_limit>).
Reason: The problem includes open routes (O), backhaul demands (B) with separate linehaul and backhaul customers, distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). Since each gallery is either a delivery (linehaul) or pickup (backhaul) and no explicit mixed backhaul (MB) is mentioned, 'B' applies. Combining O, B, L, and TW gives 'OVRPBLTW' as the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 72
Description: A construction firm requires timely material delivery (linehaul) to active sites and waste pickup (backhaul) post-work hours. Each site has strict access times (TW) for deliveries and pickups. Trucks (C) must carry heavy loads without exceeding weight limits. Routes are restricted by daily distance limits (L) to prevent driver fatigue. Starting from the depot, crews first supply materials, then collect debris, ending at the depot for waste disposal—ensuring compliance with site schedules and safety protocols.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) with waste pickup post-linehaul, distance limits (L) to prevent driver fatigue, and time window (TW) constraints for site access. The requirement to start and end at the depot excludes "O" (open route). Since all three attributes (B, L, TW) are present and interdependent, the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPB, Index: 48
Description: A fashion brand cycles inventory between temporary pop-up shops (`<loc_customer>`). Trucks with `<capacity>`-unit capacity transport new stock (`<demand_linehaul>`) from a warehouse (`<loc_depot>`) while retrieving unsold items (`<demand_backhaul>`). Routes are optimized to restock high-priority locations first, with no requirement to return to the depot.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul demands (retrieving unsold items), requires open routes (no return to depot), and prioritizes linehaul before backhaul (high-priority restocking first). The capacity constraint is present but secondary to the backhaul and open route features. There is no mention of mixed backhaul (MB), distance limits (L), or time windows (TW), making 'OVRPB' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPB, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 77
Description: A sports rental company supplies equipment like kayaks, bicycles, and camping gear to customers for temporary use. The company must deliver equipment to pickup locations (e.g., parks, resorts) as linehaul stops and later retrieve it after the rental period ends as backhaul stops. Each vehicle must complete all deliveries before starting pickups to avoid mixing gear types or overloading. The depot, rental sites, equipment quantities, and return schedules are fixed. The goal is to optimize routes to reduce mileage and ensure timely gear availability for subsequent rentals.
Reason: The problem requires vehicles to complete all deliveries (linehaul) before starting pickups (backhaul), indicating a backhaul constraint (B). Additionally, "return schedules are fixed" and the need for "timely gear availability" imply time window constraints (TW) for both deliveries and pickups. There is no mention of mixed backhauls (MB), open routes (O), or distance limits (L). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 7
Description: A municipal program delivers fresh meals (<demand_linehaul>) to schools and collects food waste (<demand_backhaul>) for composting. Electric trucks (<capacity>) operate between <time_windows> (e.g., 6–9 AM deliveries before classes, 2–4 PM pickups after lunch). Mixed routing allows stopping at School A for delivery, then School B for pickup before returning to School C for delivery. Capacity must account for both meal crates and compost bins. Late arrivals disrupt academic schedules.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as both deliveries and pickups can occur in any order, time windows (TW) for specific service times, and the example route does not end at the depot, implying an open route (O). Capacity constraints exist but are secondary to MB, TW, and O. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 79
Description: A drone rental service delivers survey drones to construction sites for topographic mapping and retrieves them afterward. Each site has a delivery window before survey operations begin and a pickup window after completion. Delivery trucks must first transport drones (linehaul) to all locations, then return to collect them (backhaul). Capacity limits restrict the number of drones per truck, and routes are constrained by distance to cover regional projects efficiently. All deliveries must arrive before survey starts, and pickups must occur after project deadlines.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (delivery) and backhaul (pickup) demands with the requirement that deliveries must be completed before pickups (B). Each site has time window constraints for delivery and pickup (TW), and the routes are subject to distance constraints (L). Since all three features (B, L, TW) are present and there is no indication of open routes (O) or mixed backhaul (MB), the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 81
Description: A civil engineering firm must deploy teams to install floodgates in vulnerable areas before predicted storm surges (<time_windows>). Each site requires specific materials (<demand>), and vehicles (<capacity> ton capacity) must start from a central depot (<loc_depot>). Due to limited fuel and road accessibility, routes must not exceed <distance_limit> km. Teams must arrive at each location within critical timeframes to prevent catastrophic flooding.
Reason: The problem includes distance limits (L) due to fuel and road accessibility constraints, and time window constraints (TW) as teams must arrive within critical timeframes. There is no mention of backhaul (B), mixed backhaul (MB), or open routes (O). Capacity (C) is present but is ignored since L and TW are included. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 67
Description: A food truck network requires fresh cooking equipment and supplies (linehaul) to be delivered to bustling city locations, while simultaneously collecting used cooking oil and waste materials (backhaul). Each delivery truck can carry up to <capacity> kg, and routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius of the central kitchen to ensure timely returns. The solution must balance load distribution and route efficiency to minimize fuel costs and environmental impact.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul and backhaul demands which can be addressed simultaneously (Mixed Backhaul, "MB"), distance limits ("L") for routes, and no explicit mention of time windows ("TW") or open routes ("O"). The presence of mixed backhaul and distance constraints makes VRPMBL the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 32
Description: An energy provider services outdoor festivals by delivering generators (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting depleted fuel tanks (<demand_backhaul>) to/from venues (<loc_customer>). Trucks (capacity <capacity>) depart from a central yard (<loc_depot>) with strict <distance_limit> constraints to ensure same-day returns. Setup/teardown time windows (<time_windows>) vary by venue. Crews end routes at the last venue to assist with equipment installation.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as crews end at the last venue, backhaul (B) for collecting fuel tanks, distance limits (L) for same-day returns, and time windows (TW) at venues. These attributes collectively match the OVRPBLTW variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 7
Description: A furniture retailer partners with an appliance recycling program to deliver new sofas and appliances (linehaul) to customers’ homes while simultaneously collecting old furniture and electronics (backhaul). Delivery trucks have a <capacity> kg limit to balance the weight of outgoing items (e.g., heavy sofas) and incoming recyclables (e.g., TVs, mattresses). Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km range to avoid long detours, and drivers conclude their routes at the final customer address. The company seeks cost-effective delivery paths that maximize recycling pickup without overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as drivers end at the final customer, mixed backhaul (MB) since linehaul and backhaul are handled simultaneously, and distance limits (L). Capacity constraints are present but subordinate to these features. No time windows (TW) are mentioned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 99
Description: A coastal logistics company manages daily redistribution of goods between floating markets (<loc_customer>) using boats that depart from a central hub (<loc_depot>). Each vessel has limited cargo space (<capacity>) and must serve markets during specific tidal windows (<time_windows>) when docks are accessible. Operations involve both delivering fresh produce (linehaul) and collecting unsold items (backhaul) in any order. Routes cannot exceed 50 nautical miles (<distance_limit>) due to fuel constraints. The solution must optimize this mixed-load routing while accommodating tidal schedules and capacity limits.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as both linehaul and backhaul can be satisfied in any order, distance limits (L) due to fuel constraints, and time windows (TW) for tidal schedules. The presence of these three features (MB, L, TW) makes 'VRPMBLTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 65
Description: A company must deliver new turbine components to offshore wind farms (linehaul) while collecting outdated equipment for recycling (backhaul). The transport vessels have a maximum capacity of <capacity> tons, requiring careful load balancing. Routes must ensure vessels return to the coastal depot within a <distance_limit> nautical mile limit to avoid refueling en route. The goal is to minimize total travel distance while safely handling both deliveries and pickups, adhering to strict environmental regulations.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as both linehaul and backhaul are handled simultaneously, distance limits (L) due to the <distance_limit> constraint, and capacity considerations. The presence of both MB and L makes VRPMBL the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 31
Description: A mobile veterinary service visits neighborhoods to administer pet vaccinations (linehaul) and collect blood samples for lab testing (backhaul). Each clinic van (<capacity> for supplies/samples) must serve appointments within strict time windows (<time_windows>) to align with pet owners’ availability. Routes are constrained by a maximum daily operating duration (<time_limit> hours) to ensure staff welfare. The mixed backhaul requirement allows sample pickups to occur before or after deliveries.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) allowing pickups and deliveries in any order, time windows (TW) for appointments, and capacity constraints. Although capacity is present, the presence of MB and TW takes precedence. There's no mention of open routes (O) or distance limits (L). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 16
Description: A movie studio coordinates equipment rentals for multiple shooting locations (<loc_customer>). Trucks depart from a rental warehouse (<loc_depot>) with mixed loads: delivering cameras/lighting (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting used props (<demand_backhaul>). Each location has narrow time windows (<time_windows>) aligned with shooting schedules. Vehicles have weight limits (<capacity>) and maximum daily operating hours (<time_limit>). Crews keep trucks overnight at the last location to avoid empty return trips.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as trucks stay overnight at the last location instead of returning to the depot. It includes mixed backhauls (MB) since both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (collections) occur simultaneously. Time windows (TW) are explicitly mentioned as narrow and aligned with shooting schedules. Capacity constraints are present but secondary to other features. The combination 'OVRPMBTW' accurately captures all these elements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: VRPMBLTW, Index: 34
Description: During a multi-venue festival, crews transport projection equipment (<demand_linehaul>) to cinemas (<loc_customer>) while retrieving press kits (<demand_backhaul>). Vehicles (capacity: <capacity> items) from the central warehouse (<loc_depot>) must optimize mixed stop sequences under <distance_limit> constraints to meet screening schedules. This ensures timely setup and copyright-sensitive material recovery.
Reason: The problem involves mixed linehaul and backhaul (MB) due to simultaneous transport and retrieval, distance limits (L) as specified by <distance_limit>, and time window constraints (TW) implied by the need to meet screening schedules for timely setup. Therefore, the most specific variant is VRPMBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 69
Description: Cargo spacecraft (<capacity>) departing from <loc_depot> must deliver experiments (<demand_linehaul>) to orbital labs (<loc_customer>) during precise docking windows (<time_windows>), while retrieving completed samples (<demand_backhaul>). Strict weight limits and microgravity constraints require optimal mixed sequencing of transfers.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (<time_windows>) for service, indicating 'TW'. It requires handling both linehaul (<demand_linehaul>) and backhaul (<demand_backhaul>) demands with 'optimal mixed sequencing', which aligns with 'MB' (mixed backhaul). The spacecraft depart from a depot but are not explicitly required to return, suggesting an open route ('O'). Capacity (<capacity>) is present but superseded by 'O', 'MB', and 'TW' features. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 71
Description: A grocery chain operates in a city, delivering fresh produce to stores (linehaul) and collecting food waste for composting (backhaul). Deliveries must occur before stores open (TW), while pickups happen after closing hours (TW). Trucks (C) are limited in size to fit city streets, and routes must not exceed municipal distance limits (L) to reduce emissions. Drivers begin at the central depot, deliver produce, then collect waste, concluding at the depot for processing—without redundant returns to reduce fuel use.
Reason: The problem includes backhaul (B) with specific time windows (TW) for deliveries and pickups, distance limits (L) on routes, and requires vehicles to start and end at the depot (excluding 'O'). The presence of B, L, and TW makes 'VRPBLTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 15
Description: A postal service operates a fleet of vehicles to deliver parcels to households and businesses while simultaneously collecting outgoing mail. Each vehicle has a capacity of <capacity> and must visit locations (<loc_customer>) with delivery demands (<demand_linehaul>) and pickup requests (<demand_backhaul>). Time windows (<time_windows>) ensure deliveries align with business hours, while route distances are capped at <distance_limit> to maintain efficiency. The goal is to minimize total travel time while ensuring all deliveries and pickups are completed within constraints.
Reason: The problem description includes backhaul (B) demands that must be satisfied after linehaul, distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). These elements correspond to the VRPBLTW variant, which combines backhaul, distance-limited routes, and time window constraints. The presence of multiple constraints (B, L, TW) necessitates the selection of the most specific variant that includes all relevant features.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 82
Description: A semiconductor manufacturer relies on just-in-time delivery of fragile components (<demand>) to multiple fabrication plants (<loc_customer>). Delivery trucks (<capacity> kg capacity) must depart from a logistics hub (<loc_depot>), adhering to stringent time windows (<time_windows>) to avoid production halts. Routes must also respect <distance_limit> km limits to prevent overheating of climate-controlled cargo compartments.
Reason: The problem description includes time windows (<time_windows>) and distance limits (<distance_limit> km), corresponding to the TW and L attributes. There is no mention of backhaul (B) or open routes (O), so the most specific variant is VRPLTW, which combines capacity (implicitly handled by the vehicle description), distance limits, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 68
Description: A safety equipment provider supplies hardhats, harnesses, and tools to construction sites, then retrieves used gear for sterilization. Vehicles (<capacity> kg) must deliver equipment before <time_window> start times to avoid delays in site operations. After crews finish shifts, trucks return to the same sites to collect gear, ensuring no pickups occur until all deliveries are complete. The <service_time> includes safety inspections at each site, requiring precise scheduling to meet strict occupational health deadlines.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (B) constraints, where pickups can only occur after all deliveries are completed, and time window (TW) constraints for deliveries to meet site start times. The presence of both B and TW makes VRPBTW the most specific variant, as it accounts for the sequential handling of deliveries and pickups alongside time-sensitive requirements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 87
Description: A marketing firm rotates digital billboard displays (<loc_customer>) across city locations using trucks with <capacity> display panels. Each site has specific installation time slots (<time_windows>) to avoid peak traffic. Routes must finish within <time_limit> hours due to daylight constraints. Trucks depart from the warehouse (<loc_depot>) but remain at their final location for overnight security. Mixed operations allow simultaneous removal of old ads (backhaul) and installation of new ones (linehaul) at each stop.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as trucks do not return to the depot, mixed backhaul (MB) due to simultaneous removal (backhaul) and installation (linehaul) at each stop, and time window constraints (TW) for installation slots. The daylight constraint (time_limit) is a route duration limit, but since the definitions provided do not explicitly include a duration-specific code, TW is prioritized. Other variants like VRPBLTW or OVRPBTW are less specific as they lack the mixed backhaul (MB) aspect.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 93
Description: A telecom provider upgrades rural internet infrastructure by deploying 5G equipment (linehaul) and collecting outdated antennas (backhaul). Sites require installation during maintenance windows (time windows) to avoid service disruptions. Technicians have an 8-hour working shift (duration limit), and trucks must prioritize deliveries before pickups to prevent blocking access to tower sites. Capacity constraints demand careful scheduling to avoid overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) because pickups (collecting outdated antennas) must occur after deliveries (deploying 5G equipment), time windows (TW) due to maintenance windows, and capacity constraints. However, since B and TW are present, capacity (C) is ignored. There is no mention of open routes (O), mixed backhaul (MB), or distance limits (L). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 94
Description: A polar research team resupplies remote Antarctic outposts with food, fuel, and scientific tools (linehaul) while retrieving ice core samples and waste (backhaul). Deliveries and pickups must align with narrow time windows dictated by seasonal weather windows and aircraft availability. Flights have strict 6-hour round-trip limits (duration limit) due to fuel constraints, and cargo capacities are tightly regulated to balance weight between outbound and inbound loads.
Reason: The problem involves both linehaul (deliveries) and backhaul (pickups) with no explicit requirement for linehaul to precede backhaul, suggesting mixed backhaul (MB). Additionally, time windows (TW) are specified for deliveries and pickups. The 6-hour round-trip duration limit could relate to route duration, but according to the user's definitions, 'L' refers to distance limits, not time. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPMBTW, combining mixed backhaul and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 27
Description: A rotating pop-up shop network requires daily inventory redistribution. Vans (capacity <capacity> units) depart from a warehouse (<loc_depot>) to deliver new stock (<demand_linehaul>) and retrieve unsold items (<demand_backhaul>) from temporary locations (<loc_customer>). Tight time windows (<time_windows>) align with mall access hours. Drivers end routes at assigned overnight parking to avoid empty returns, respecting shift duration limits (<time_limit> hours).
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at parking, mixed backhaul (MB) for simultaneous linehaul and backhaul, and time windows (TW) for customer access. Capacity is present but superseded by other features.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 95
Description: A space agency must resupply a lunar outpost with scientific equipment, life-support materials, and emergency supplies. Rockets departing from Earth’s launchpad (<loc_depot>) have a maximum payload capacity (<capacity> kg). Each delivery must align with narrow orbital launch windows (<time_windows>) to minimize travel time and energy consumption. Rockets also face a strict distance limit (<distance_limit>) due to fuel constraints, requiring precise trajectory planning to reach the moon and return to transfer points. The challenge is to schedule launches and allocate cargo optimally while ensuring all supplies reach the outpost within operational timelines and capacity limits.
Reason: The problem involves rockets that must adhere to time windows (<time_windows>) for launches, distance limits (<distance_limit>) due to fuel constraints, and open routes (since rockets return to transfer points rather than the original depot). These correspond to the TW (time window), L (distance limit), and O (open route) attributes. No backhaul (B) is mentioned, so the most specific variant is OVRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 15
Description: After a natural disaster, relief organizations must deliver essential supplies to affected areas and collect hazardous waste from contaminated sites. Vehicles depart from a central warehouse, first delivering medical kits, food, and water (linehaul) to disaster zones (must arrive within specific time windows to prioritize urgent needs). After deliveries, they proceed to collect medical waste or debris (backhaul) from designated sites. Each vehicle has a limited capacity, ensuring supplies and waste do not exceed the load. Routes must stay within a maximum distance to avoid overextending teams, and deliveries must precede pickups to ensure timely aid distribution. The goal is to minimize travel distance while adhering to time constraints and operational limits.
Reason: The problem includes backhaul (B) with linehaul preceding backhaul, distance limits (L) on routes, and time windows (TW) for deliveries. These features align with the VRPBLTW variant, which combines backhaul, distance constraints, and time windows. The absence of open routes (O) or mixed backhaul (MB) further confirms the selection.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: VRPTW, Index: 42
Description: A hospital chain operates on strict shift schedules, requiring fresh linen deliveries (C) to wards by the start of morning, afternoon, and night shifts (TW). Linen trucks must complete all deliveries within an 8-hour window (L) to comply with driver shift limits and avoid disrupting patient care. Routes must balance load capacities, time windows for ward access, and the need to return to the central laundry facility daily.
Reason: The problem specifies time windows (TW) for deliveries aligned with shift starts and a route duration limit (8-hour window). Although the description mentions load capacities, TW takes precedence. The requirement to return to the depot excludes open routes (O). No backhaul (B) or distance limits (L) are explicitly stated, making VRPTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 10
Description: A blood bank operates mobile donation units that visit corporate offices, universities, and community centers (<loc_customer>) to collect donations. Each site has a time window (<time_windows>) for hosting the unit and a target donation volume (<demand>). Vehicles (capacity <capacity>) start from the blood bank (<loc_depot>), collect donations in any order (MB), and end at the final site (O). Routes must respect daily distance limits (<distance_limit>) to ensure staff safety.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles end at the final site, distance limits (L) due to daily constraints, and time windows (TW) at each site. There is no mention of backhaul demands (B), and while 'MB' is noted in the description, it refers to collection order flexibility, not mixed backhaul (which requires both linehaul and backhaul demands). Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 34
Description: Electric hearses (capacity: <capacity>) coordinate eco-friendly burials by delivering biodegradable caskets to families (<demand_linehaul>) and collecting floral tributes for composting (<demand_backhaul>) across cemeteries (<loc_customer>). Narrow time windows (<time_windows>) reflect funeral ceremony schedules. Routes respect cultural protocols (e.g., never transporting caskets and flowers simultaneously) while optimizing for battery range.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) demands (floral tributes collected after delivering caskets), distance limits (L) due to battery range constraints, and time windows (TW) for cemetery visits. The inability to transport caskets and flowers simultaneously confirms strict backhaul sequencing (not mixed backhaul, MB). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 42
Description: A seafood company services offshore aquaculture cages (<loc_customer>) using boats that deliver feed (<demand_linehaul>) and harvest mature fish (<demand_backhaul>). Vessels with <capacity> ton limits must navigate tidal time windows (<time_windows>) when cages are accessible, completing routes within <time_limit> hours due to crew safety regulations. The mixed sequence of deliveries/pickups is constrained by perishability timelines for both feed and fresh catch.
Reason: The problem involves Mixed Backhaul (MB) as deliveries and pickups can be sequenced together, Time Windows (TW) due to tidal accessibility constraints, and vehicle capacity (C). However, since MB and TW are present, capacity is ignored in the classification. The time limit for route completion is a separate constraint but not represented by "L" (distance limits), so VRPMBTW is the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBTW, Predicted: VRPBTW, Index: 66
Description: A pharmaceutical company delivers time-sensitive medications to pharmacies and nursing homes, while simultaneously retrieving empty pill bottles for recycling. Each vehicle carries a <capacity> kg payload, balancing delivery demands (<demand_linehaul>) and pickup quotas (<demand_backhaul>). Pharmacies have strict <time_window> windows for receiving perishable drugs, while bottle pickups must occur after the facility’s closing hours. Drivers must complete all deliveries before initiating pickups, ensuring compliance with health regulations and avoiding overloading trucks.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) with a requirement to complete deliveries before pickups, time window (TW) constraints for both deliveries and pickups, and capacity (C) considerations. Since B and TW are present, they take precedence over C. The description does not mention open routes (O), distance limits (L), or mixed backhaul (MB), leading to the selection of VRPBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPLTW, Predicted: VRPLTW, Index: 89
Description: A wellness company expands its network of mountain retreats, requiring delivery of exercise machines and yoga gear. Each retreat (<loc_customer>) has staff availability windows (<time_windows>) for unloading. Delivery vans (<capacity> ton capacity) depart from a distribution center (<loc_depot>), but steep mountain roads restrict their travel range (<distance_limit> km). The goal is to schedule routes ensuring all equipment arrives within time constraints, while preventing overloading and avoiding route distances beyond the vans’ operational limits.
Reason: The problem includes time windows (<time_windows>) for customer service, distance limits (<distance_limit> km) due to mountain road constraints, and vehicle capacity (<capacity>). According to the classification rules, since both "L" (distance limits) and "TW" (time windows) are present, the variant should include these attributes. The problem does not mention open routes (O), backhaul (B), or mixed backhaul (MB), so the most specific variant is VRPLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 96
Description: A maritime logistics company supplies safety equipment and emergency kits to offshore oil platforms and retrieves hazardous waste fluids for disposal. Vehicles must first deliver linehaul items (safety gear) before collecting backhaul waste. Each vessel has a limited capacity, and routes are constrained by a maximum distance to avoid extended fuel shortages. The challenge is to design paths that reach all platforms efficiently while adhering to both capacity and distance limits.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul demands (B) which must be collected only after delivering linehaul items, and distance limits (L) on routes to prevent fuel shortages. There is no mention of open routes (O) or time windows (TW), and the backhaul is strictly sequenced after linehaul (not mixed). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 75
Description: A school district needs to distribute science lab kits to schools for seasonal science fairs and collect them afterward. Each school has a time window for delivery setup and a separate window for post-event returns. Delivery trucks must first deliver the kits (linehaul) before returning to collect the used equipment (backhaul). Each truck has a capacity limit for both new and returned items. Routes must stay within a maximum distance to prevent driver exhaustion, ensuring all deliveries are completed before the fairs begin and pickups occur after the events conclude.
Reason: The problem requires backhauls (B) with separate linehaul and backhaul phases, distance limits (L) to prevent driver exhaustion, and time windows (TW) for both deliveries and pickups. These constraints are all present, so the most specific variant is VRPBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMB, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 19
Description: A solar farm operator shuttles charged batteries (<demand_linehaul>) to remote microgrids (<loc_customer>) while retrieving depleted units (<demand_backhaul>). Electric trucks (<capacity>) optimize stop order (e.g., swapping batteries at one site before delivering to another) and park at the final microgrid for recharging, leveraging open routes to align with energy availability.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as trucks do not return to the depot, mixed backhaul (MB) because linehaul (delivering charged batteries) and backhaul (retrieving depleted units) can be handled simultaneously (e.g., swapping at one site before delivering to another), and distance limits (L) due to the trucks needing to park for recharging. There is no mention of time window constraints (TW). Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 70
Description: A chemical logistics company must deliver hazardous materials to industrial facilities (linehaul) and retrieve used containers for recycling (backhaul). Each delivery must occur within the client’s operational hours (TW), while pickups align with environmental regulations. Vehicles have strict capacity limits (C) to avoid overloading. Routes must stay within a daily distance limit (L) to comply with safety protocols. Starting from the depot, drivers first deliver chemicals, then collect waste containers, ending the route at the depot for proper disposal—ensuring no unnecessary return trips beyond the final task.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW) for deliveries, backhaul (B) constraints requiring linehaul completion before pickups, distance limits (L) for routes, and vehicles must return to the depot (no "O" open route). The presence of B, L, and TW makes VRPBLTW the most specific variant.

Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 68
Description: A healthcare logistics firm redistributes MRI and CT scanners (linehaul) to hospitals while collecting biohazard-contaminated waste (backhaul) from imaging labs. Hospitals demand equipment within specific operational hours to avoid downtime, and waste must be retrieved within 4 hours of generation. Vehicles are restricted to a 250km route to ensure waste freshness and have dual capacity limits for medical gear and hazardous materials. Routes terminate at the last hospital without depot return.
Reason: The problem includes open routes (O) as vehicles do not return to the depot, mixed backhaul (MB) since linehaul (equipment delivery) and backhaul (waste collection) occur simultaneously on the same route without strict order enforcement, distance limits (L) of 250km, and time window constraints (TW) for hospital deliveries and waste retrieval. These features align with the 'OVRPMBLTW' variant.

Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 76
Description: A utility company deploys new smart meters to residential neighborhoods while collecting outdated meters for recycling. Technicians must first deliver new meters (linehaul) within homeowners’ scheduled time windows, then return to retrieve the old units (backhaul). Each van’s capacity restricts the number of meters it can carry. Routes are capped at a distance limit to ensure timely service, with all installations finalized before the next billing cycle and pickups completed within a week.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) where linehaul must be completed before backhaul, distance limits (L), and time windows (TW). There is no indication of open routes (O) or mixed backhaul (MB), making VRPBLTW the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 49
Description: A telecommunications company deploys submersibles to repair deep-sea internet cables. Crews must first deliver repair kits (<demand_linehaul>) to fault locations (<loc_customer>), then salvage damaged segments (<demand_backhaul>). Each repair window (<time_windows>) is dictated by ocean current patterns, with service taking <service_time> hours. Submersible vessels (capacity <capacity>) must complete repairs before surfacing within a <distance_limit> km radius of the support ship (<loc_depot>). The challenge is coordinating repair sequences, avoiding payload overloads, and meeting time-sensitive oceanic conditions.
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as damaged segments are salvaged after delivering repair kits, distance limits (L) due to the radius constraint, time windows (TW) dictated by ocean currents, and open routes (O) since submersibles do not return to the depot but surface nearby. The combination of O, B, L, and TW makes 'OVRPBLTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPBL, Index: 8
Description: Research vessels depart from a coastal base (<loc_depot>) to deploy sensors (<demand_linehaul>) at ocean sites (<loc_customer>) and retrieve logged data (<demand_backhaul>). Ships (capacity: <capacity>) cannot exceed <distance_limit> nautical miles per trip due to fuel constraints. Routes terminate at the final research site, allowing vessels to remain on standby for further missions.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as routes terminate at the final site, backhaul demand (B) for data retrieval, and distance limits (L) due to fuel constraints. These features correspond to the 'O', 'B', and 'L' attributes, making 'OVRPBL' the most specific variant. Capacity is mentioned but superseded by the presence of other attributes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPBL, Predicted: VRPMBL, Index: 50
Description: A solar energy company must deliver newly manufactured solar panels to remote rural communities (linehaul) and simultaneously collect used lithium-ion batteries from previous installations (backhaul). Each truck has a capacity of <capacity> kg, requiring careful balancing between the weight of panels and the volume of returned batteries. Routes must stay within a <distance_limit> km radius to ensure vehicles can return to the depot before depleting fuel, especially in rugged terrain. The goal is to optimize delivery efficiency while adhering to environmental regulations for battery disposal.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as both linehaul and backhaul demands are handled simultaneously, a distance limit (L) due to the fuel constraint, and vehicles must return to the depot (excluding 'O'). There is no mention of time windows (TW). Capacity is present but secondary to the MB and L constraints. Thus, the most specific variant is VRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: VRPBL, Index: 97
Description: A rescue team deploys emergency kits, medical supplies, and climbing gear to remote mountain shelters (linehaul) and later retrieves used equipment for maintenance. The vehicles must deliver critical supplies first, then collect returned gear. Each vehicle has a capacity limit, and routes must stay within a distance threshold to ensure rescuers can return safely without refueling. The goal is to service all shelters while minimizing total travel distance and respecting operational constraints.
Reason: The problem involves both backhaul (B) where vehicles must deliver linehaul goods before collecting backhaul items, and distance limits (L) on routes. There is no mention of time windows (TW) or open routes (O), as vehicles must return safely (closed routes). Thus, the most specific variant is VRPBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 65
Description: A green energy company operates mobile charging units to service electric vehicles (EVs) across a city. Each truck (capacity <capacity>) starts at a depot (<loc_depot>) and must:  
- Deliver charged battery packs to designated swap stations (<loc_customer>, demand <demand_linehaul>).  
- Collect depleted batteries from the same or other stations (<demand_backhaul>).  
Routes can mix deliveries and pickups freely, but trucks cannot exceed their battery capacity or travel beyond <distance_limit> km per shift due to operational constraints.  
The goal is to minimize total distance while ensuring all stations are serviced without overloading vehicles.
Reason: The problem involves mixed backhaul (MB) as deliveries and pickups can be freely mixed, distance limits (L) due to the <distance_limit> constraint, and open routes (O) since the description does not specify that trucks must return to the depot. There are no time window (TW) constraints mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 76
Description: An aviation maintenance provider supplies replacement parts to airports for aircraft repairs (linehaul) and collects defective components (backhaul) for analysis. Trucks start from a central depot and conclude routes at the final airport, avoiding return journeys. Each vehicle’s capacity (C) must accommodate both new parts and returned items. Distance limits (L) ensure operational efficiency in remote regions, preventing fuel shortages or extended delays.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as trucks do not return to the depot, mixed backhaul (MB) since both linehaul and backhaul are handled during the same routes (collecting defective parts while delivering replacements), and distance limits (L) for operational efficiency. These features correspond to the OVRPMBL variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPBLTW, Index: 67
Description: An airport catering service must:  
- Deliver pre-ordered meals from kitchens (<loc_depot>) to aircraft (<loc_customer>) during boarding windows (<time_windows>)  
- Collect unused meals and trash (MB)  
- Operate within strict tarmac driving time limits (L)  
Refrigerated trucks (<capacity>) complete routes without returning to base (O), prioritizing flights by departure time.
Reason: The problem involves Open routes (O) as trucks do not return to base, Backhaul (B) for collecting unused meals and trash after deliveries, strict driving time Limits (L), and Time Windows (TW) for boarding. The combination of these features corresponds to the OVRPBLTW variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 47
Description: An environmental NGO coordinates boats (capacity: <capacity>) to both deploy empty recycling bins along coastal communities (<loc_customer>) and collect ocean plastic waste. Starting from a port (<loc_depot>), each vessel's mixed delivery-pickup route must stay under <distance_limit> nautical miles due to fuel constraints.
Reason: The problem involves mixed delivery-pickup routes (MB), distance limits (L), and does not specify returning to the depot (O). Capacity is mentioned but other features take precedence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 63
Description: A healthcare provider operates mobile testing units (capacity: <capacity>) to visit clinics (<loc_customer>), conducting tests while redistributing surplus PPE supplies between locations. Clinics have time-sensitive testing windows (<time_windows>) and service times (<service_time>) for sample collection. Vehicles must balance test kit deliveries and supply pickups in any sequence, staying within daily operational limits (<distance_limit>) to maintain cold chain integrity. Demand (<demand>) includes both test kits delivered and supplies collected.
Reason: The problem involves time windows (TW), mixed backhauls (MB) as deliveries and pickups can be in any sequence, distance limits (L), and there is no explicit requirement for vehicles to return to the depot, implying an open route (O). Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBLTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPMBTW, Index: 44
Description: A hydrogen fuel distributor services <num_customer> refueling stations (<loc_customer>) using cryogenic trucks with <capacity> kg H₂ capacity. Vehicles perform simultaneous deliveries of fresh hydrogen (<demand_linehaul>) and retrievals of empty cylinders (<demand_backhaul>), constrained by station operating hours (<time_windows>) and maximum route durations (<time_limit>) to maintain fuel pressure. Mixed sequences must account for varying fill/empty times (<service_time>) at each stop.
Reason: The problem involves simultaneous handling of linehaul (fresh hydrogen delivery) and backhaul (empty cylinder retrieval), which corresponds to Mixed Backhaul (MB). Additionally, time window constraints (station operating hours) are present. The presence of route duration limits relates to time constraints but does not introduce a distance limit (L). There is no mention of open routes (O), so the standard VRP assumption of returning to the depot holds. Thus, the variant is VRPMBTW.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 20
Description: A blood donation organization operates mobile units that visit various locations (<loc_customer>) to collect donations while also returning processed blood samples to the central lab (<loc_depot>). Each unit has a <capacity> limit for both fresh donations and samples, and must adhere to strict time windows (<time_windows>) due to donor appointments and sample viability constraints. Routes must optimize travel distance while ensuring no unit exceeds its operational duration limit (<distance_limit>).
Reason: The problem involves backhaul (B) as vehicles must return samples to the depot after collecting donations, time windows (TW) due to donor appointments and sample viability constraints, and distance limits (L) on operational duration. These elements align with the VRPBLTW variant, which combines backhaul, distance limits, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 2
Description: A renewable energy company installs solar panels (linehaul) and retrieves old panels for recycling (backhaul). Installations must occur within <time_window> to align with customer schedules, while recycling pickups follow environmental compliance deadlines. Trucks have a <capacity> kg limit for panel transport and cannot exceed <distance_limit> km to conserve fuel. Routes end at the final recycling pickup point to streamline logistics.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (ending at the final pickup point), mixed backhauls (linehaul and backhaul can be interleaved based on time windows and deadlines), distance limits, and time window constraints for both installations and pickups. These correspond to the attributes 'O', 'MB', 'L', and 'TW', making 'OVRPMBLTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBTW, Predicted: OVRPMBTW, Index: 33
Description: A nomadic retailer rotates high-end inventory between temporary pop-up locations (<loc_customer>) using climate-controlled vans (capacity: <capacity>). Each stop either receives new merchandise (<demand_linehaul>) or returns unsold items (<demand_backhaul>) during mall operating hours (<time_windows>). Sequencing must accommodate last-minute venue booking changes while preventing overcrowding during peak shopping periods.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vans do not need to return to the depot, mixed backhauls (MB) due to simultaneous linehaul and backhaul demands at stops, and time window constraints (TW) for mall operating hours. These elements align with the OVRPMBTW variant, which combines open routes, mixed backhauls, and time windows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPMBL, Predicted: OVRPMBL, Index: 42
Description: After a hurricane, aid teams distribute emergency kits (`<demand_linehaul>`) to affected areas while collecting storm debris (`<demand_backhaul>`) for disposal. Vehicles (capacity: `<capacity>`) depart from a relief hub (`<loc_depot>`) to serve `<num_customer>` sites (`<loc_customer>`). Mixed sequences are allowed (e.g., deliver food before collecting debris at the same location). Routes are limited to `<distance_limit>` km due to fuel scarcity. The objective is to maximize aid delivery and cleanup efficiency.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as there is no mention of returning to the depot, mixed backhaul (MB) since linehaul (aid delivery) and backhaul (debris collection) can occur in any order at the same location, and distance limits (L) due to fuel constraints. No time windows (TW) are mentioned. Thus, the most specific variant is OVRPMBL.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: VRPBLTW, Index: 25
Description: A renewable energy firm must deploy new solar inverters to remote farms (<loc_customer>) while collecting expired panels for recycling. Delivery trucks (<capacity> kg) start at a depot (<loc_depot>), must complete installations before dusk (<time_windows>). Farmers require service between 8 AM–2 PM to avoid heat stress, and inverters weigh <demand_linehaul> kg. Recycling pickups (<demand_backhaul>) must follow deliveries, as panels cannot be mixed with live equipment. Each route is capped at <distance_limit> km to ensure drivers reach before sunset.
Reason: The problem includes backhaul (B) with recycling pickups after deliveries, distance limits (L) on routes, and time windows (TW) for service. There's no indication of open routes (O) as trucks may need to return to the depot after pickups. The combination of B, L, and TW makes 'VRPBLTW' the most specific variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: OVRPBLTW, Predicted: OVRPMBLTW, Index: 47
Description: A scientific institute needs to replace outdated lab equipment across universities (<loc_customer>) by delivering new gear (linehaul) and collecting old machinery (backhaul). Each university has a service time (<service_time>) for calibration and a time window (<time_windows>) aligned with lab downtimes. Vehicles (<capacity>) must not exceed <distance_limit> to ensure timely swaps, and routes terminate at the final destination to avoid depot return logistics.
Reason: The problem involves open routes (O) as vehicles terminate at the final destination, mixed backhaul (MB) since each university requires both delivery (linehaul) and pickup (backhaul), distance limits (L) for vehicles, and time windows (TW) for service. These attributes align with the 'OVRPMBLTW' variant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Label: VRPLTW, Predicted: OVRPLTW, Index: 70
Description: Museums worldwide loan priceless artifacts to temporary exhibitions, requiring precise logistics. Vehicles must transport fragile items from a central depot (<loc_depot>) to exhibition venues (<loc_customer>), each with specific time windows (<time_windows>) to align with installation schedules. Each truck has a limited cargo capacity (<capacity>) to protect artifacts from overcrowding, and routes must stay within a maximum distance (<distance_limit>) to prevent extended exposure to vibrations. The goal is to ensure artifacts arrive undamaged and on time while minimizing total travel distance.
Reason: The problem includes time windows (<time_windows>), distance limits (<distance_limit>), and does not explicitly require vehicles to return to the depot, implying open routes (O). The combination of O, L, and TW makes OVRPLTW the most specific variant.
