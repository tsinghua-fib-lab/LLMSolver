Specifically, for products with large demand fluctuations, companies need to accurately predict demand and formulate corresponding production plans. A certain company produces a type of foldable table, the raw material cost for each product is 90 Yuan, and the labor hours are 5 hours. The unit price of the product is 300 Yuan. The company has 1,000 workers at the beginning of January and holds an inventory of 15,000 units. The regular hourly wage for workers is 30 Yuan, with a normal daily working time of 8 hours. Any extra working time is considered overtime, with an overtime hourly wage of 40 Yuan. The number of working days per month is calculated as 20 days. Suppose the company's available production machines are sufficient, and the capacity is not limited by machine hours. Each worker's overtime hours do not exceed 20 hours per month. Holding inventory will generate corresponding inventory costs. If a stockout occurs due to insufficient capacity, there will be certain stockout costs. Additionally, the company can also make up for the stockout part through outsourcing. The outsourcing cost per product, monthly inventory cost, and monthly stockout cost are 200 Yuan, 15 Yuan, and 35 Yuan, respectively. The company's employees are temporary workers, and the company can flexibly decide the number of people to hire and fire each month. The cost of hiring and firing a single employee is 5,000 Yuan and 8,000 Yuan, respectively.

        "desc_split": "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) was first proposed by Dantzig in 1959 (Dantzig and Ramser 1959). It is a very classic combinatorial optimization problem. The basic VRP can usually be described as: In a certain area, there are a certain number of customers and a distribution center or warehouse. Customers are generally distributed in different locations, and each customer has a certain amount of delivery needs. The distribution center or warehouse needs to dispatch a fleet of vehicles and design an appropriate delivery plan to meet the delivery needs of all customers. The goal of VRP is to optimize efficiency while meeting all customer needs. The efficiency is usually measured in the form of an objective function, which varies with the enterprise's requirements. Common objective functions include minimizing the total distance traveled by vehicles, minimizing the total delivery time, and minimizing the number of vehicles used. In addition to meeting customers' delivery needs, VRP usually needs to consider various constraints, giving rise to various variants. For example, if the vehicle's load must not exceed its maximum capacity, the problem becomes the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP); if each customer's delivery needs must be met within a specific time window, the problem changes to the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW).\n\nThe Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is a classic problem developed from VRP. In reality, there are many application scenarios for VRPTW. Each customer point generally has a service time window. For example, some logistics centers need to store packages during less busy times, some large supermarkets need to replenish stocks during non-business hours, and real-time delivery methods such as food delivery require delivery within specific time windows. Time windows are divided into soft time windows and hard time windows. Hard Time Windows (HTW) mean that vehicles must arrive at or before the delivery point within the time window and cannot arrive late. If they arrive early, they must wait until the time window starts to perform the service, such as in supermarket restocking and logistics center warehousing. Soft Time Windows (STW) mean that vehicles do not have to arrive within the original hard time window but should try to arrive within it. If vehicles arrive early, there is a cost for early arrival; if they arrive late, there is a penalty, as seen in scenarios such as food delivery, school bus pick-up and drop-off, and industrial delivery.\n\nThe Vehicle Routing Problem with Hard Time Windows (VRPHTW) can be described as follows: There are a certain number of customer points and a distribution center in an area. Vehicles need to depart from and return to the distribution center, and routes should be continuous, with each customer being served by only one vehicle. Vehicles also have a capacity constraint. Each customer has a specific service time window and will only accept service within this window. Vehicles can arrive at customer points early and wait for the time window to open, or they can arrive within the time window to provide service. Vehicles can only start providing service within the time window, and the service time is known. The distribution center needs to arrange a reasonable delivery plan to complete the delivery tasks while minimizing travel costs. Since VRPHTW does not allow delays, it primarily emphasizes travel costs on the routes, similar to VRP. Please now proceed with operations research modeling for VRPHTW.",
