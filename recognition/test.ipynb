      "Description: Imagine a city advertising campaign where you need to strategically place billboards and promotional materials to reach all 10 key locations efficiently. Each location has a specific demand for advertising, ranging from a small need of 3.33% to a larger need of 20%. The campaign starts and ends at a central depot, and there are no backhaul demands to consider. \n",
      "\n",
      "Your goal is to determine the optimal route from the depot to each location, ensuring that the total advertising material used does not exceed the vehicle's capacity of 1 unit. Each location has a unique advertising requirement, and the route must be planned without any time window constraints. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since there are no distance or speed limits, the focus is on minimizing the number of vehicles used while meeting the advertising demands at each location. The campaign can open routes to any location as needed, and the service time at each location is negligible.\n",

      "Description: In this advertising placement scenario, you have a central depot located at coordinates (0.4983, 0.3834) and 10 customer locations across a city.

      "- **Distance Limit**: The maximum distance a vehicle can travel is 2.2236 units, ensuring that the route does not exceed this limit.\n",
      "- **Time Windows**: There are no specific time windows for placing advertisements at any of the locations, meaning the placement can happen at any time.\n",
      "- **Service Time**: No additional service time is required at any of the locations.\n",
      "- **Vehicle Capacity**: The vehicle used for placing advertisements can carry a total capacity of 1 unit, meaning it can place a total of 1 advertisement at any combination of locations.\n",
      "- **Open Route**: The route is not required to be open, meaning it can be a closed loop if necessary.\n",
