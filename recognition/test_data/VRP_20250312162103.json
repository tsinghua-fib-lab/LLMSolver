The distance limit is not restrictive, allowing for unlimited travel between locations. There are no time windows to adhere to, giving flexibility in when ads can be placed at each location. The service time at each location is also zero, meaning there is no additional time required beyond the placement of the ads. Each ad placement route must be opened, and there is only one vehicle available with a capacity to place a total of 1 ad across all customer locations.
